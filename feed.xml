They were all written between 31-Jul-2019 and 1-Dec-2019.  Now there are three including this one.  I had been reading them over and over again and decided all but &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/31/wheres-grandma.html&quot;&gt;“Where’s Grandma”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/11/armistice-day.html&quot;&gt;“Armistice Day”&lt;/a&gt; needed to be removed to reduce the amount of aimless rambling on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m uncovering information fairly regulary, even through the Covid-19 pandemic, and I just feel a lot of what I had posted was incomplete snippets of one unfinished story.  Although it isn’t possible to tell truly complete family history stories, I should at the very least tell everything I know.  I should also wait until I know enough to tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anything-interesting-here&quot;&gt;Anything interesting here?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mother was Jewish and my Father was not.  I have concentrated on my Jewish Grandmother’s side of my family because this all started when my Mum said she wanted to know what happened to her Mum.  They fell out around 1949/50 and never saw each other again.  Earlier, when I said my family history has turned out to be more than I bargained for, let me just spend a little time outlining some of what I know, and therefore a taste of what will be included in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Great Great Grandparents on my Grandmother’s side were Jacob Solomons and Hannah (Levinson) Solomons as shown in the graphic at the top of the post.  It seems Hannah, if not Jack, was born in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Veisiejai%2Clithuania#map=14/54.1002/23.6952&quot;&gt;Vishay (Veisiejai), Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; in 1862.  They arrived in England before September 1881 when the first of their eight children was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her name was Esther Solomons and she is my Great Grandmother.  Esther went to New York in September 1906, seems to have met a married man on board, and nine months later, gave birth to my Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=fulbourne%20street%2C%20london#map=19/51.51938/-0.06204&quot;&gt;Fullbourne Street, London&lt;/a&gt;.  Then in September 1907, she returned to New York without Eva, who was left with Hannah to be brought up.  Esther ended up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=prince%20rupert%2C%20canada#map=13/54.2703/-130.3058&quot;&gt;Prince Rupert, Canada&lt;/a&gt; in 1913, married a greek Candy Maker cum Cook and was then brutally murdered in 1928.  It was front page news for days and remains unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eva got married in 1926, gave birth to my Mum in 1928, was seperated from my Grandfather in 1931 and ended up marrying a Cat Burglar from Bristol who once robbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Aitken,_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook&quot;&gt;Lord Beaverbrook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacob and Hannah’s next three children were all boys.  Hyman was a Cabinet Maker, Louis worked as a Fruit Merchant and Alexander was a Commercial Traveller who lost his life in France during WWI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next came four girls.  The first was Kitty who followed Esther to Canada, where she got married, and was murdered in the same street as Esther was murdered, though almost exactly 17 years to the day afterwards.  She left my Mum a one and one-half carat single diamond ring in her will.  It was an argument over the whereabouts of this ring which lead to my Mum and Grandmother falling out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three girls were Rachael, Dinah and Rebecca. Rachael was a Tailoress, Dinah worked as a Fur Coat Finisher and Liner, but I do not know what work Rebecca was employed in. My Mum knew Hannah as well as all her children apart from Esther and Alexander, who died before she was born in 1928.  It was my Mum who told me all the names in the graphic at the top of this post, as well as their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mother lived in 126 Long Acre, London, with a lady she called an Aunt, who Mum says witnessed a murder that I have found was of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=1275&amp;amp;termRef=Dora%20Freedman&quot;&gt;Russian Dora&lt;/a&gt;.  Though probably not my family, I have been keeping an eye on Dora, whose real name is Helen Freedman.  The Electoral Register shows my Mum lived there two years after the Murder of Helen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I set out to find what happened to my Grandmother, I never expected brutal murders, prostitution and other crimes to feature as much as they have.  On saying that, most of the time, my family history is full of people just living their lives as best as they can, loving their children and being loved back.  The experience of tracing my family history has also brought me into contact with many kind and generous people from around the world who, otherwise, I would never have met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-that-it-then&quot;&gt;Is that it then?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are further stories on my Jewish Grandfather’s side, and goodness knows what my Dad’s side will bring up.  I have purposely left the detail behind some of these stories for the posts to come, including what I found to be the most upsetting story of them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here ends the quick roundup of some of what I know.  If there are still just three posts on this site when you are reading this, please be assured I have almost finished the fourth post ready for publication, and have the next lined up to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please come back soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">Before today there were 6 posts on this blog about my Jewish family history, which has turned out to be more than I bargained for.

&lt;p&gt;There are a few thousand people on site, with a mix of military and civilian personel.  The first time I attended I was expecting a jingoistic service, but nothing of the sort.  Senior leaders and military in their uniforms is the closest it ever gets.  There is very little pomp and ceremony to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s service included &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/EDS3TxtGaQ0&quot;&gt;The Last Post&lt;/a&gt; and The Rouse (unless I am mistaken) played by a lone bugler from a balcony.  There were short readings by various people and the Padre gave a short sermon which mixed some humour in with a serious message.  The theme of the sermon was for us to think hard about what we say, because the language now being used in public life is degenerating into dangerous territory.  He reminded us of how fragile democracy was and how the way we behave can undermine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two minutes silence took place in the sunshine, and my thoughts were with my 2nd Great Uncle, pictured above, Private 43440 Alexander Solomons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wartimememoriesproject.com/greatwar/allied/battalion.php?pid=6090&quot;&gt;10th Battalion the Royal Dublin Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt;.  He died in the battlefields of Flanders on Friday, 28 April 1917 (6 Iyyar 5677).  His body was not recovered, but he is remembered on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-cemeteries-and-memorials/82700/arras-memorial&quot;&gt;Arras Memorial&lt;/a&gt;.  I have not been there yet, but one day I will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;family-history-follow-up&quot;&gt;Family history follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to gather together the documents I have on Esther and Kitty and send them to Eric Holdijk and Sue Harper.  I shall tell Sue about Eric as well.  I also need to write a note to the current Police Commissioner in Prince Rupert to introduce myself, ask for information and advise the coroner got the wrong age for Esther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, died on 8 December 1985 and I would really like to discover where her grave is before that date comes around again this year so I can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/putting-stones-on-jewish-graves/&quot;&gt;place some stones&lt;/a&gt; there.  Her home was in Bedminster at the time of her death and the South Bristol Cemetery and Crematorium is in Bedminster so it is a likely location.  I have a number and email address so I will send an email tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-changes&quot;&gt;Blog changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set a new Journal section on this blog and am writing a few posts to see if it is something I can keep up at least weekly.  Once I have a few more posts, i will publish to the internet site for all to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another set of changes I need to introduce to the site include a google search of it and the use of tags and categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also aim for a post at least every couple of weeks, but before that I need to catch-up with linking from the jump pages to the real blogs, and then always remember to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was nearly 10 years old, my Dad told me my Mum was Jewish.  When Mum found out, she insisted on making me promise not to tell anyone.  She worried how people would react if they knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum was 11 years old at the start of World War II.  She was evacuated from London to Exmouth in Devon.  Like many evacuees, she returned to London before the end of the war, and when it finished she was just 17 years old and working as a waitress in central London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years after the end of the war, she saw her Mum for the last time, as they fell out over a ring she’d been left by a murdered aunt.  Mum never received the ring, but my Grandma didn’t believe her.  I now know she never received it, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered secondary school fairly soon after I found out my Mum was Jewish.  I was put into the German half and expected to learn German as a foreign language.  Mum said it was a little like Yiddish, but she made it clear she would never want to go to Germany.  It was a fear she lived with all her adult life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine how that felt for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now her secret was out, I was full of questions and she was full of stories and a few vague answers.  She provided quite a few short anecdotes about people and places, but Hannah Solomons, and her Mum, Eva Lichtenstein, were the two she mentioned the most, closely followed by the Long Acre Aunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannah was her Great Grandmother who Mum lived with until she died in 1937, just before my Mum turned 9.  Hannah and her husband Jacob came to this country from somewhere in Eastern Europe.  My Mum wasn’t sure where, but I believe I now know the name of the village in Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mum described herself as being pushed from pillar to post after Hannah died.  She once lived in a house full of stuffed birds and there were never any bird ornaments or pictures in our home.  She clearly liked her cousins and would probably like to have seen them again, but what she really wanted was to find out what happened to her Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding my Grandma was what started me off in Family History research, but I never applied myself as much as I could have done.  Unfortunately my Mum died in 2004 and never knew what had become of her Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-many-aunts-so-few-names&quot;&gt;So many Aunts, so few names?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to my Mum talk about her life, you would be forgiven for thinking she had many Aunties.  The truth be told she had none.  Some were Great Aunts, some other relations and I suspect some were people she respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the Aunt she lived with in Long Acre who witnessed a murder.  Another Aunt lived in Colvestone Crescent in Dalston, often buying Lox and Cream Cheese Bagels from the Ridley Road bakery at the end of the street.  I musn’t forget the paranoid Aunt who lived south of the river, as well as the one in Lambeth.  For all I know, some of these people could have been the same person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also an Aunt Bessie from Prince Rupert in Canada, who visited a few times, but was murdered over there.  I’ve since found this was a big story in Prince Rupert.  Not least because of the murder of Aunt Bessie’s sister almost exactly 17 years to the day before.  It turns out Aunt Bessie’s sister was the first real murder in Prince Rupert.  It also turns out she was my Great Grandmother.  I believe my Mum never knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also had friends and occasionally gave them a name, but most people she told me about had places and stories but not names. At least not ones I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time my Dad announced Mum was Jewish, he also told me she had thought her name was Jacqueline Morris, which is the name on their Marriage Certificate.  They found out it was Chemerofsky when they tried to emigrate to Australia.  We spent about 3 years and 3 months living in Australia, but came back mostly because my Mum didn’t settle there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia turned out to be traumatic due to a German family out there called the Neudatch’s.  It really stressed Mum out.  She was homesick for a country where she had lost contact with her family and friends, yet when our feet touched the tarmac at Gatwick, I’m sure she bent down and kissed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-little-acorns-grow-great-oaks&quot;&gt;From little acorns grow great oaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did eventually manage to drag a few names out of Mum, did a little bit of research in the 1980s and 1990s, put it aside and got on with my life.  My Mum died in 2004 and a few years later I tried again in 2009, but the desire wasn’t met by action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of antisemitism in the world at large, and the Labour Party in particular, of which I am a member, lead me up to a time in 2018 when the desire to honour my Mum’s quest to find my Grandma, took over me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have concentrated on the female line through my Grandmother.  I am in contact with a wonderful second cousin who does a great job with my Grandfather’s side.  I also want to learn more about Jews.  I was very close to my Mum, she taght me how to cook and bake, much of it forgotten now.  I am half-Jewish, and although I have yet to step inside a Synagogue, I feel a need to get more in touch with my inner Jew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that Journey I have read some of Simon Schama’s books (more than once), read My Jewish Learning site regularly, have Esther Ansell as my favourite fictional heroine and regulary read books by Jewish authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have uncovered lots of stories about my family and will try and write them up on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking about looking into your family history, please don’t do what I did.  Please ask lots of questions of your relatives, write lots of notes and better still record conversations with them.  Try and get names and places and dates.  Ask the same question in different ways at different times.  This can trigger additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously began my research based on the following notes, which I have also reproduced as they are on the now fading paper I still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began with wanting to know what happened to my Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, and have ended up learning far more than I expect about my Jewish family and myself.  There are still gaps and questions and although I’ve hardly begun, it’s been a roller coaster of emotion at times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">This is a photo of Eva Lichtenstein, who is my maternal Grandmother.
