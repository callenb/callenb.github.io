Hannah Levison and Jacob Solomons came to England from eastern europe as a result of the anti-Jewish pograms.  I don’t know when they came but I do know they were here on 25th September 1881 because that is when my Great Grahndmother and their first child was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage in my family history research I have the makings of some interesting stories from this family alone.  Jacob died of Consumption when their first born was 17, which must have been devestating for everyone in the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time Hannah died, one son had spent the 1911 Census in Wormwood Scrubs and later gave his life on the battlefields of Flanders and a daughter was brutally murdered a month after her Granddaughter was born.  Less than 10 years after Hannah died another daughter was murdered under similar circumstances to the first.  Both murders took place in the same foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found this Family History journey fascinating, as I suspect most people’s family histories are.  It has also been quite upsetting, but as I discover more about being Jewish, it has been an unexpectedly uplifting personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write blog posts but every time I nearly finish one, some more information comes to light to investigate and I never publish the post.  With this blog post I am putting a stake in the ground to say I will write up what I know at the time and update it later.  I will begin with just this family of eight children and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum lived with Hannah until she was nearly nine years old and loved her dearly.  She spoke about her often and I feel it is right to start here.  Her father’s family has some interesting stories too, including making the front page of the national newspapers in 1928 and a four year old who was killed as the result of a car accident when coming out of school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t even started on my father’s side yet so goodness knows what else is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jacob-solomons-and-hannah-solomns-nee-levison&quot;&gt;Jacob Solomons and Hannah Solomns nee Levison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebmd.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Free BMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ancestry.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Ancestry&lt;/a&gt; to search for the marriaje certificate of Jacob Solomons and Hannah Levison and then Ancestry for an entry in the 1881 Census but found nothing I can be 100% confident is them.  However, I have something which is close enough to be a possibility for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/1880/MAR-18801229_jacob_solomons_and_annie_levison.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Potential marriage certificate of Jacob Solomons and Hannah Levinson&quot; title=&quot;Potential marriage certificate of jacob Solomons and Hannah Levinson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a marriage certificate for a Jacob Solomons and Annie Levison for 29th December 1880.  “Hannah” may well sound like “Annie” to an english registrar with little experience of east european accents, especially if I was the registrar!  Jacob is 22 years old and Annie is 21.  Jacob has the occupation of a Journeyman Tailor which is in line with other birth certificates, marriage certificates and the 1891 Census.  They were living at 6 Sandy’s Row, opposite the Synagogue, but were married in Princes Street Synagogue by what looks to me like Isaac Cohen Levy.  Their marriage was witnessed by who I think are “I Woolf” and “A Heisen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The names have a good match, the marriage is 9 months before my Great Grandmother was born, so just in time. Jacob’s occupation is right, but their ages are different to the 1891 Census as they are seven years apart there and not just the one as here.  Their respective death certificates also indicate a margin more like seven than one.  This could be a registrar error or assumption, especially if neither could write english at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;great-grandmother-esther-solomons&quot;&gt;Great Grandmother Esther Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a photograph of Little Patternoster Row, where my Great Grandmother, Esther Solomons was born.  My mother told me she was married to Jack or Jacob Lichtenstein but never seemed to know anything else about her.  I found out why, when I discovered she was brutally murdered in Prince Rupert, Canada when my Mum was little more than a month old.  Esther’s murder has featured in an ebook and finding out about her murder and her life beforehand is an ongoing investigation I suspect may never truly end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/places/london/little_patternoster_row.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Little Patternoster Row where Esther Solomons was born&quot; title=&quot;Little Patternoster Row, Spitalfields, London&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther was born in 12 Little Patternoster Row, although her parents were living in 13 Crispin Street at the time.  Parts of both streets back on to each other, although I believe number 13 Crispin Street did not.  It adds a little more confidence to the 1880 marriage certificate as they clearly knew people in Little Patternoster Row.  Why else would Esther be born somewhere apart from at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther must have had an interesting life, born in the worst street in Whitechapel according to Charles Booth, she ended up going to New York, having two husbands and being murdered in Canada with a little under Canadian $10,000 in her probate.  Not bad for a woman who describes herself as a Dressmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hyman-solomons&quot;&gt;Hyman Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard this name I thought it was great, and still do.  I wasn’t brought up as a Jew and so didn’t know how common some of these names are, or what they mean.  Hyman is associated with “life” as in the Hebrew word Chaim.  I read it is often added to an ill person’s name to aid recovery.  I hope it was not the case here and it is more like the song “To Life” from Fiddler on the Roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyman Solomons was born on 13th June 1883 and I believe he died in 1966.  When my mother listed out the names of Hannah’s children for me, Hyman came last, but I think she listed her Great Aunts first and then her Great Uncles from youngest to eldest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;louis-solomons&quot;&gt;Louis Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left-flow&quot; src=&quot;/images/people/louis_solomons.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Louis Solomons&quot; title=&quot;Louis Solomons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my Mum told me about Louis was he lived in Leman Street and had 2 daughters.  To date he is the only one I have an image of in the shape of this photo of a painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another claim to fame is so far he is the only one who has a descendent I have managed to contact and there are more Grand-children still alive, which is great for all sorts of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The birth certificate of Louis Solomons actually has his first name spelt as “Lewis” but his Grandson assures me it is spelt “Louis” and I’m 100% certain he is right.  Lewis had three daughters rather than the two my Mum recalled.  He was a Cabinet Maker and I hope to find some more about him and posisbly get some other pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time of the 1901 Census, Jacob has died and Louis, at the age of 17, is the only one of the children not listed in the Census. There’s always something to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alexander-solomons&quot;&gt;Alexander Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum referred to him as “Alec” and that is what is on his birth certificate.  However, all his army records and the memorial in France has his name as Alexander Solomons.  The 1911 Census has a lady called Bessie or Cissie Smith living with her and described as her Daughter-in-law.  It turns out this was his wife and he appears to be an inmate in Wormwood Scrubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kitty-solomons&quot;&gt;Kitty Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum knew Kitty Solomons and I thought she referred to her as Aunt Betsy but I could be wrong.  She told me she came across from Prince Rupert in Canada, treated my Grandmother like she was her own but was murdered in Prince Rupert.  In about 1949, my Mum had received a letter from the Chief of Police in Prince Rupert about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty and my Grandmother Esther were both murdered whilst living on the same block in Comox Avenue, but 17 years apart, almost to the day.  The similarities in the way they were murdered and how the house was left are striking to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their murders remain unsolved to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rachel-solomons&quot;&gt;Rachel Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first person my Mum had on her list of Hannah’s children was Rachel Solomons.  She must have been quite close to her and her family as she knew her husband’s name, two children and when one of the children was married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that I know very little about Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dinah-solomons&quot;&gt;Dinah Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum has told me Dinah married Ike and had a Greengrocer’s in Hackney.  She had three children, Jack, Alex and Kitty and it has all been found to be true.  Ike’s real name is Isaac Abrahams and if I can triangulate some of my research, I believe one of his ancestors was a founding member of the Jewish Board of Deputies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rebecca-solomons&quot;&gt;Rebecca Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resident of Forest Gate, Rebecca Solomons was married to Abraham Fagan, who my Mum called Abe.  They had a son they named Jacques who my Mum called Jack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jacques got married it was to a lady who lived around the corner, which is almost girl next door territory and quite romantic as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-next-steps&quot;&gt;My Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I am going to do.  I will be using this post as a jump page to articles about each of these people as and when I write them up.  I wanted to start with Esther and Kitty as their story is dramatic, but I think I’ll start with something with less mystery and work my way up to Esther and Kitty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Hannah Levison and Jacob Solomons came to England from eastern europe as a result of the anti-Jewish pograms.

&lt;p&gt;This is a photo of Eva Lichtenstein, who was my maternal Grandmother who I never met.  She is Jewish. I learned my Mum was Jewish from my Dad when I was about 9 years old.  Mum had always been too scared to mention it to anyone just in case they turned against her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was concerned when I ended up in the German half at school designating it as the foreign language for me to learn, rather than French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum was 11 years old when she was evacuated from London at the start of World War 2 and was 17 when it ended in 1945.  Germany was the very last country in the world she would ever want to go to.  It was a fear she lived with all her adult life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine how that felt for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now her secret was out, I was full of questions and she was full of stories and a few vague answers.  She provided quite a few short anecdotes about people and places, but Hannah Solomons, who was her Great Grandmother and her Mum, Eva Lichtenstein, were the two she missed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was an 8 year old girl when Hannah died in January 1937, but she last saw her Mother in 1949 and always wanted to know what happened to her.  Finding my Grandma was what started me off in Family History research, but I never applied myself as much as I could have done.  Unfortunately my Mum died in 2004 and never knew what had become of her Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-many-aunts-so-few-names&quot;&gt;So many Aunts, so few names?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to my Mum talk about her life, you would be forgiven for thinking she had many Aunties.  The truth be told she had none.  Some were Great Aunts, some other relations and I suspect some were people she respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the Aunt she lived with in Long Acre who witnessed a murder.  An Aunt Bessy from Prince Rupert in Canada who visited a few times, but was murdered in Prince Rupert. Another Aunt who lived in Colvestone Crescent in Dalston, often buying Lox and Cream Cheese Bagels from the Ridley Road bakery at the end of the street.  I musn’t forget the paranoid Aunt who lived south of the river as well as the one in Lambeth.  Some of these people could well be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also had friends and occasionally gave them a name, but most people she told me about had places and stories but not names. At least not ones I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time my Dad announced Mum was Jewish, he also told me she had thought her name was Jacqueline Morris, which is the name on their Marriage certificate.  They found out it was Chemerofsky when they tried to emigrate to Australia.  We spent about 3 years and 3 months living in Australia but came back mostly because my Mum didn’t settle there.  She was homesick for a country where she had lost contact with her family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia turned out to be traumatic due to a German family out there.  It really stressed Mum out and when our feet touched the tarmac at Gatwick, I’m sure she bent down and kissed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-little-acorns-grow-great-oaks&quot;&gt;From little acorns grow great oaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did eventually manage to drag a few names out of Mum, did a little bit of research in the 1980s and 1990s, put it aside and got on with my life.  I tried again in 2009, but the desire wasn’t met by action.  Then various events leading up to a time in 2018 when the desire to learn more about where I came from and to actually find out where my Grandmother was took over me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have concentrated on the Jewish side and particularly the female line.  I also wanted to learn more about Jews, after all I am half-Jewish, and although I have yet to step inside a Synagogue, I feel a strong affinity with that part of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that Journey I have read some of Simon Schama books (more than once), read My Jewish Learning site regularly, have Esther Ansell as my favourite fictional heroine and regulary read The Eternal Dissident as well as soak up information about Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have uncovered lots of stories about my family and will try and write them up on this blog.  If you are thinking about looking into your family history, please don’t do what I did.  Please ask lots of questions of your relatives, write lots of notes and better still record conversations with them.  Try and get names and places and dates.  Ask the same question in different ways at different times.  This can trigger additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously began my research based on the following notes, which I reproduce exactly as I wrote them on the now fading paper I still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(1) Aunt Bessy disturbed burglars and was murdered in Prince Rupert.  Jacqueline received a letter from the commissioner of police in Prince Rupert c1949.  Bessy left her a ring in her a ring (£500) in her will.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mark was a “court” hairdresser and worked for a madam Prunay? In Hackney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began with wanting to know what happened to my Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, and have ended up learning far more than I expect about my Jewish family and myself.  There are still gaps and questions and although I’ve hardly begun, it’s been a roller coaster of emotion at times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
