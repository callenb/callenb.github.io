&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am hoping you may help me locate the grave of my grandmother which is hopefully in your cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Her name at the time of her death on 8 December 1985 was Elizabeth Purchase, however she was born as Eva Lichtenstein and this has been written Lichenstein on her death certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Her family home at the time of her death was 15 Hastings Road, Bedminster, Bristol hence my enquiry to your cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’d appreciate any help you can provide me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Best Regards&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Barrie Callender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon received an email asking me to confirm her name at the time of death and I responded that it was indeed Elizabeth Purchase.  A week after I responded, I received another email which said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi Barrie&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thank you for confirming.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Purchase lived in Clevedon aged 78 yrs, she was cremated at South Bristol Crematorium and her ashes were interred into our ‘ A Garden’ – exact reference is A54/9.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have attached a map of our cemetery and also a grid reference of the A Garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never written to a cemetery before, and I am pleasantly surprised by not only how quickly they got back to me, but the care they showed in providing information about my Grandmother to help me clarify if indeed it was her.  This is a cemetery in current use and I really wasn’t expecting this level of service.  Thank you South Bristol Cemetery and Crematorium!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears their is nothing to mark where my Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, has been interned.  Although I work about 100 miles from where I live, the cemetery is just over 7 miles away from where I work, so there is no excuse not to go there.  Thanks to what my Mum has told me, what I have found out and also what I read in the book Tony Purchase wrote, I have discovered a lot more about my Grandmother, but there is still more to know.  I have the major events but I want to know more about who she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, I have found my Grandma, as I promised my Mum, and as satisfying as that should feel, there is more I want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I have added reference A54/9 in the ‘A Ggarden’ of South Bristol Cemetery and Crematorium of places to visit before I die, or hopefully before next Sunday, which marks the anniversary of her death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-progress-with-esther-solomons&quot;&gt;Some progress with Esther Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted Sue Harper and Eric Holdijk regarding the documents to share about Esther and actually found it easier to share all the documents I have in Google Docs.  Erik’s manager is going to the British Columbia Archives in December and may be able to get hold of the probrate for Esther, which I am interested in reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik has already sent me the Coroner’s report, which I found both useful and interesting.  Useful, because it told me Esther’s husband, Harry Killas, had pre-deceased her.  I had assumed he was still alive when she was murdered.  It was interesting because I have never seen a Coroner’s report report.  All those times, one reads in a newspaper about what a Coroner’s report has said, and I never knew what they were like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never seen a probate either so I hope I will be fortunate enough to get a copy of Esther’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-changes&quot;&gt;Blog changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to just go ahead and put this journal section of ramblings out there and see what happens.  After a burst of activity to produce two entries, there then followed a lull before the third entry you are reading appeared.  I guess regular just isn’t something I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided there really isn’t any point in implementing a google search on the site yet so will leave that until there are a few more posts.  The categories and tags can wait for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to write another post about a member of the family even if it is incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">I recently sent an email to South Bristol Cemetery and Crematorium, the contents of which was:</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/people/eva_lichtenstein.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/people/eva_lichtenstein.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Armistice Day</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/11/11/armistice-day.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Armistice Day" /><published>2019-11-11T19:54:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-11T19:54:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/11/11/armistice-day</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/11/11/armistice-day.html">&lt;p&gt;I currently work at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence&quot;&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; establishment and this being Armistice Day there is always a service outside which starts just before 11:00am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few thousand people on site, with a mix of military and civilian personel.  The first time I attended I was expecting a jingoistic service, but nothing of the sort.  Senior leaders and military in their uniforms is the closest it ever gets.  There is very little pomp and ceremony to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s service included &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/EDS3TxtGaQ0&quot;&gt;The Last Post&lt;/a&gt; and The Rouse (unless I am mistaken) played by a lone bugler from a balcony.  There were short readings by various people and the Padre gave a short sermon which mixed some humour in with a serious message.  The theme of the sermon was for us to think hard about what we say, because the language now being used in public life is degenerating into dangerous territory.  He reminded us of how fragile democracy was and how the way we behave can undermine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two minutes silence took place in the sunshine, and my thoughts were with my 2nd Great Uncle, pictured above, Private 43440 Alexander Solomons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wartimememoriesproject.com/greatwar/allied/battalion.php?pid=6090&quot;&gt;10th Battalion the Royal Dublin Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt;.  He died in the battlefields of Flanders on Friday, 28 April 1917 (6 Iyyar 5677).  His body was not recovered, but he is remembered on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-cemeteries-and-memorials/82700/arras-memorial&quot;&gt;Arras Memorial&lt;/a&gt;.  I have not been there yet, but one day I will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;family-history-follow-up&quot;&gt;Family history follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to gather together the documents I have on Esther and Kitty and send them to Eric Holdijk and Sue Harper.  I shall tell Sue about Eric as well.  I also need to write a note to the current Police Commissioner in Prince Rupert to introduce myself, ask for information and advise the coroner got the wrong age for Esther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, died on 8 December 1985 and I would really like to discover where her grave is before that date comes around again this year so I can lay some flowers there.  Her home was in Bedminster at the time of her death and the South Bristol Cemetery and Crematorium is in Bedminster so it is a likely location.  I have a number and email address so I will send an email tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blog-changes&quot;&gt;Blog changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set a new Journal section on this blog and am writing a few posts to see if it is something I can keep up at least weekly.  Once I have a few more posts, i will publish to the internet site for all to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another set of changes I need to introduce to the site include a google search of it and the use of tags and categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also aim for a post at least every couple of weeks, but before that I need to catch-up with linking from the jump pages to the real blogs, and then always remember to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">I currently work at a Ministry of Defence establishment and this being Armistice Day there is always a service outside which starts just before 11:00am.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/1917/alexander_solomons_6-DEC-1887_28-APR-1917.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/1917/alexander_solomons_6-DEC-1887_28-APR-1917.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The story behind the stories</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/11/10/the-story-behind-the-stories.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The story behind the stories" /><published>2019-11-10T20:43:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-10T20:43:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/11/10/the-story-behind-the-stories</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/11/10/the-story-behind-the-stories.html">&lt;p&gt;I am ever so grateful to the many people who have reached out to help me with my family history research, as well as those who encourage and show an interest.  When I started I thought I would end up finding where my grandmother was buried and maybe find something mildly interesting in the family.  It hasn’t quite turned out like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to start this journal to better capture some of what I encounter as time goes by.  My family history isn’t the only interest I spend my time on and think about, so this journal section will hopefully contain some of the other subjects as well as a little of the background of my family history research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off with, I’ll tell you about my current daily commute to work.  I am a contractor so the next job will be a differnt commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current commute to work begins with a short 3 minute journey to the local train station, followed by an 8 minute train journey to the nearest main line station.  I then tend to walk up and down the platform for a few minutes until I catch the main line train to take me about 100 miles away in about an hour.  Finally I walk the mile or so to where I work.  The first train leaves at 6:41 and I arrive at work a couple of minutes before 8:30.  At the end of the day I do the reverse, but with less time between trains at the main line station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having arrived in work at 8:30 in the morning, I usually leave at 17:00, but frequently later.  The main train journey is an hour long and it gives me plenty of time to read books and articles, listen to podcasts and occasionally program on my way to work, and nobody interrupts me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who measure steps, I usually do about 13,000 according to my fitbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be surprised if this journal takes a little while to get up and running regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">I am ever so grateful to the many people who have reached out to help me with my family history research, as well as those who encourage and show an interest.

I don’t know when they came but I do know they were here on 25th September 1881 because that is when my Great Grahndmother and their first child was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage in my family history research I have the makings of some interesting stories from this family alone.  Jacob died of Consumption when their first born was 17, which must have been devastating for everyone in the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time Hannah died, one son had spent the 1911 Census in Wormwood Scrubs and later gave his life on the battlefields of Flanders and a daughter was brutally murdered a month after her Granddaughter was born.  Less than 10 years after Hannah died another daughter was murdered under similar circumstances to the first.  Both murders took place on the same street in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found this Family History journey fascinating, as I suspect most people’s family histories are.  It has also been quite upsetting, but as I discover more about being Jewish, it has been an uplifting personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to write blog posts but every time I nearly finish one, some more information comes to light for me to investigate and I never publish the post.  With this blog post I am putting a stake in the ground to say I will write up what I know at the time and update it later.  I will most likely begin with this family of eight children and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum lived with Hannah until she was nearly nine years old and loved her dearly.  She spoke about her often and I feel it is right to start here.  Her father’s family has some interesting stories too, including making the front page of the national newspapers in 1928 and a four year old who was sadly killed as the result of a car accident when coming out of school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t even started on my father’s side yet so goodness knows what else is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jacob-solomons-and-hannah-solomns-nee-levison&quot;&gt;Jacob Solomons and Hannah Solomns nee Levison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebmd.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Free BMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ancestry.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Ancestry&lt;/a&gt; to search for the marriaje certificate of Jacob Solomons and Hannah Levison and then Ancestry for an entry in the 1881 Census but found nothing I can be 100% confident is actually them.  However, I have something which is close enough to be a possibility for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1880/MAR-18801229_jacob_solomons_and_annie_levison.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Possible marriage certificate of Jacob Solomons and Hannah Levinson&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a marriage certificate for a Jacob Solomons and Annie Levison for 29th December 1880.  “Hannah” may well sound like “Annie” to an english registrar with little experience of east european accents, especially if I was the registrar!  Jacob is 22 years old and Annie is 21.  Jacob has the occupation of a Journeyman Tailor which is in line with other birth certificates, marriage certificates and the 1891 Census.  They were living at 6 Sandy’s Row, opposite the Synagogue, but were married in Princes Street Synagogue by what looks to me like Isaac Cohen Levy.  Their marriage was witnessed by who I think are “I Woolf” and “A Heisen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The names have a good match, the marriage is 9 months before my Great Grandmother was born, so just in time. Jacob’s occupation is right, but their ages are different to the 1891 Census as they are seven years apart there and not just the one as here.  Their respective death certificates also indicate a margin more like seven than one.  This could be a registrar error or assumption, especially if neither could write english at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;great-grandmother-esther-solomons&quot;&gt;Great Grandmother Esther Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a photograph of Little Patternoster Row, where my Great Grandmother, Esther Solomons was born.  My mother told me she was married to Jack or Jacob Lichtenstein but never seemed to know anything else about her.  I found out why, when I discovered she was brutally murdered in Prince Rupert, Canada when my Mum was little more than a month old.  Esther’s murder has featured in an ebook and finding out about her murder and her life beforehand is an ongoing investigation I suspect may never truly end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/places/london/little_patternoster_row.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Little Patternoster Row where Esther Solomons was born&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther was born in 12 Little Patternoster Row, although her parents were living in 13 Crispin Street at the time.  Parts of both streets back on to each other, although I believe number 13 Crispin Street did not.  It adds a little more confidence to the 1880 marriage certificate as they clearly knew people in Little Patternoster Row.  Why else would Esther be born somewhere apart from at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther must have had an interesting life, born in one of the worst streets in Whitechapel according to Charles Booth, she ended up going to New York, having two husbands and being murdered in Canada with a little under Canadian $10,000 in her probate.  Not bad for a woman who describes herself as a Dressmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hyman-solomons&quot;&gt;Hyman Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard this name I thought it was great, and still do.  I wasn’t brought up as a Jew and so didn’t know how common some of these names are, or what they mean.  Hyman is associated with “life” as in the Hebrew word Chaim.  I read it is often added to an ill person’s name to aid recovery.  I hope it was not the case here and it is more like the song “To Life” from Fiddler on the Roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, for as many years as I can remember, when friends raise a glass and say cheers, I have always responded with l’ chaim.  Although I can’t remember the order, I know the first two films I ever saw at the cinema were Hello Dolly and Fiddler on the Roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyman Solomons was born on 13th June 1883 and I believe he died in 1966.  When my mother listed out the names of Hannah’s children for me, Hyman came last, but I think she listed her Great Aunts first and then her Great Uncles from youngest to eldest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;louis-solomons&quot;&gt;Louis Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image left-flow&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/people/louis_solomons.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Louis Solomons&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my Mum told me about Louis was he lived in Leman Street and had 2 daughters.  To date he is the only one I have an image of in the shape of this photo of a painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another claim to fame is so far he is the only one who has a descendent I have managed to contact and there are more Grand-children still alive, which is great for all kinds of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The birth certificate of Louis Solomons actually has his first name spelt as “Lewis” but his Grandson assures me it is spelt “Louis” and I’m 100% certain he is right.  Louis had three daughters rather than the two my Mum recalled.  He was a Cabinet Maker and I hope to find some more about him and posisbly get some other pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time of the 1901 Census, Jacob has died and Louis, at the age of 17, is the only one of the children not listed in the Census. There’s always something to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alexander-solomons&quot;&gt;Alexander Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum referred to him as “Alec” and that is what is on his birth certificate.  However, all his army records and the memorial in France has his name as Alexander Solomons.  The 1911 Census has a lady called Bessie or Cissie Smith living with her and described as her Daughter-in-law.  It turns out this was his wife and he appears to have been an inmate in Wormwood Scrubs during the Census.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kitty-solomons&quot;&gt;Kitty Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum knew Kitty Solomons and I thought she referred to her as Aunt Betsy but I could be wrong.  She told me she came across from Prince Rupert in Canada, treated my Grandmother like she was her own but was murdered in Prince Rupert.  In about 1949, my Mum had received a letter from the Chief of Police in Prince Rupert about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitty and my Grandmother Esther were both murdered on the same block in Comox Avenue, but 17 years apart, almost to the day.  The similarities in the way they were murdered and how the house was left are striking to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their murders remain unsolved to this day and after all this time they will probably stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rachel-solomons&quot;&gt;Rachel Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first person my Mum had on her list of Hannah’s children was Rachel Solomons.  She must have been quite close to her and her family as she knew her husband’s name, two children and when one of the children was married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that I know very little about Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dinah-solomons&quot;&gt;Dinah Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum has told me Dinah married Ike and had a Greengrocer’s in Hackney.  She had three children, Jack, Alex and Kitty and it has all been found to be true.  Ike’s full name is Isaac Abrahams and if I can triangulate some of my research, I believe one of his ancestors was a founding member of the Jewish Board of Deputies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rebecca-solomons&quot;&gt;Rebecca Solomons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resident of Forest Gate, Rebecca Solomons was married to Abraham Fagan, who my Mum called Abe.  They had a son they named Jacques who my Mum called Jack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jacques got married it was to a lady who lived around the corner, which is almost girl next door territory and quite romantic as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-next-steps&quot;&gt;My Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I am going to do.  I will be using this post as a jump page to articles about each of these people as and when I write them up.  I wanted to start with Esther and Kitty as their story is dramatic, but I think I’ll start with something with less mystery and work my way up to Esther and Kitty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">Hannah Levison and Jacob Solomons came to England from eastern europe as a result of the anti-Jewish pogroms.

&lt;p&gt;Mum never said much about her grandmother and I suspect she never knew she had been murdered and they were never in the same country, let alone room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther’s murder was a big event for a young city and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sueharperphotography.com/&quot;&gt;Sue Harper&lt;/a&gt; has included a chapter about the murder in her book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?contributorId=216916&quot;&gt;When a Bad Wind Blows: 10 Tragic Events in the History of Prince Rupert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say lightning doesn’t strike twice, yet almost 17 years to the day after Esther was murdered, her sister, Kitty Moen, was also murdered in similar circumstances on the same street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what I have found out about Esther so far, I would love to know the detailed facts about her life story.  Esther begun her life in one of the poorest streets in Whitechapel, yet she ended up being killed in the wettest city in Canada with about $10,000 Canadian dollars in her bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;esther-solomons-of-little-patternoster-row&quot;&gt;Esther Solomons of Little Patternoster Row&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esther Solomons was born on 25 September 1881 (2 Tishrei 5642), which was the second day of Rosh Hashana when the Jewish New Year is celebrated.  Her parents were Jacob and Hannah Solomons.  Although her birth certificate has 12 Patternoster Row as the address where she was born, it was actually 12 Little Patternoster Row in Spitalfields.  Just 20 years later in 1898, Charles Booth described &lt;a href=&quot;https://booth.lse.ac.uk/notebooks/b351#?cv=55&amp;amp;c=0&amp;amp;m=0&amp;amp;s=0&amp;amp;z=730.7679%2C528.5803%2C1243.3164%2C739.5&quot;&gt;Little Patternoster Row&lt;/a&gt; thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;2 &amp;amp; 3 storey common lodging houses. Ragged women, children, holey toeless boots; windows dirty patched with brown paper and broken. Prostitutes, thieves and ponces. Buildings owned by the notorious Jack McCarthy of Dorset Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was coloured black on his map and designated as “vicious, semi-criminal”.  The Solomons didn’t live where Esther was born, they lived at 13 Crispin Street, a much wider and longer street running parallel to Little Patternoster Row.  The family must have known someone living in 12 Little Patternoster Row, and if the same people were living there 6 months before during the 1881 Census, then it was one of 6 families.  Little Patternoster Row no longer exists but some of Crispin Street does.  As far as I can tell, the place where number 13 was has become part of the Spitalfields Market extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Birth Certificate of Esther Solomons (25-Sep-1881 to 17-Apr-1928)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no Solomons living in 13 Crsipen Street on the 1881 Census.  A Jacob and Hannah Solomons are living at 8 Little Patternoster Row on the 1881 Census, but the evidence suggests it is not them.  It could be they recently arrived in London, having fled the Pogroms started around April of 1881.  If that was the case, then Hannah must have travelled whilst she was pregnant with Esther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther’s parents were Tailors.  By the time of the 1891 Census Esther was living with her parents at 31 &amp;amp; 32 Booth Street Buildings. At 9 years of age, Esther had three brothers and one sister, Kitty, who was the youngest at 1.  The three boys were: Hyman (7), Louis (5) and Alexander (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;esther-solomons-growing-up&quot;&gt;Esther Solomons growing up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have seen one or more school admission records for her siblings, I have yet to find any for Esther and so I do not know where she went to school.  This may be because there is no index available or it was transcribed incorrectly.  It seems a visit or two to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/leisure_and_culture/local_history/local_history__archives/local_history__archives.aspx&quot;&gt;Tower Hamlets local history archives&lt;/a&gt; for a search is in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther’s father had died by the time of the 1901 Census and only Louis is missing from their home at 59 Nelson Street.  Esther is 17 and a Tailoress, Hyman is a Cabinet Maker and all the other children are at school.  Esther’s youngest three siblings are sisters: Rachael (9), Dinah (6) and Rebecca (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family is living with two other families. One is a 50 year old mother and her 30 year old son who is a Traveller.  They come from Russia and it looks like his first name is Simon, but I can’t read their surname.  The other is a 60 year old Tailor called George Day and his wife Mary, both from Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was common to take in lodgers to earn a bit of extra money, and I’m assuming Hannah is the head of the house because she is listed first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;did-esther-solomons-abandon-her-daughter&quot;&gt;Did Esther Solomons abandon her daughter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Mum has told me Esther was married to Jack Lichtenstein and their only known child was my grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein.  I have never found a marriage certificate for Esther and Jack.  I have searched for every combination of their names I can think of.  The relationship between Jack and Esther, along with the abandonment of her daughter Eva, is as big a mystery to me as her murder, and in some ways no less shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1907/BTH-19070607-Eva_lichtenstein.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Birth Certificate of Eva Lichtenstein (7-Jun-1907 to 4-Dec-1985)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eva’s birth certificate describes her father, Jack Lichtenstein, as a Hairdressers Assistant, and her mother’s name is entered as “Esther Lichtenstein, formerly Solomons”, implying they were married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eva was born at 22 Fulbourne Street on 7 June 1907 (25 Sivan 5667).  The birth was registerred by Esther’s mother, Hannah Solomons, who also lived at the same address.  It was not uncommon for newly married couples to live with their parents, but I don’t believe that was the case here.  The evidence suggests Esther came back to her mother to give birth and then went away when Eva was a few months old, leaving her mother to bring up Eva.  I don’t even know if Jack came back with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day Eva was born, Hannah’s four youngest daughters were probably still at home.  Rebecca (10) and Dinah (12) were still at school.  Rachel was 15 and Kitty was 17.  My Mum knew Kitty and said she looked on Eva as if she was her daughter.  That might be because at 17 she may well have stepped into the role of Mother for Eva, whilst Esther was away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to think my Great Grandmother didn’t completely abandom my Grandmother.  In her mind, she left her to a good home, returned fairly frequently, but was clearly pulled away by something very compelling.  I know from what my Mum told me about Hannah Solomons, she would be a great person to bring up her granddaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-esther-and-jack-meet&quot;&gt;How did Esther and Jack meet?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esther seems to have lived her life in North America, firstly in New York and then in Canada until her death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest document I have is for a voyage on board Cunard’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Caronia_(1904)&quot;&gt;Corronia&lt;/a&gt; setting sail from Liverpool on 25 September 1906 and arriving in New York on 3 October 1906.  This was a new ship having completed its maiden voyage in 1905 and finally ending its days in 1933.  It lasted longer than Esther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1906/BLOG_19060925-UK-OUTWARD-esther_solomons_and_j_lictenstein.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Esther Solomons and Jack Lichtenstein on 25-Sep-1906 voyage from Liverpool to New York&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The date would be her 25th birthday according to the Gregorian calendar, but I suspect that was a coincidence.  When I first got this document I found Esther fifth from bottom where whe described herself as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hellosewing.com/tailor-vs-seamstress-dressmaker/&quot;&gt;Dressmaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a few weeks after first getting this document I was scanning down looking for Esther when the name “J Lichtenstein” jumped out at me.  Such a shame I hadn’t noticed before.  Here was a 36 year old Hairdresser with just the right initial and surname to be Jack, but then again it could be James, Julian or  Jeremy amongst others.  His age gives him a birthday about 1870.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed they had consecutive ticket numbers, Jack with 49988 and Esther with 49989.  Did they buy them together or is that a pure coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Outward passenger list from England has very little information, however the inward list on the USA side has a wealth of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1906/BLOG_19061003-US-IMMIGRATION-esther-solomons.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Esther Solomons on arrival in New York on 10 October 1906&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther is still single according to the immigration document.  She has the $50 a visitor is supposed to have and she says she hasn’t been to the United States before.  On this, her first visit, she is staying with a friend called Jack Pellar who lives in East Harlem at 116 E 116th Street.  It also tells us she is 5’ 2” tall with a ruddy complextion, black hair, blue eyes and no marks of identification such as scars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther is the only person on the page with an “X” beside her name, someone has written 1-86467 under her occupation too.  I have no idea what this refers to, maybe one day all will become clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1906/BLOG_19061003-US-IMMIGRATION-john-lichtenstein.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jack (John) Lichtenstein on arrival in New York on 10 October 1906&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out the “J” stands for John and not Jack.  He’s a Hungarian born in Budapest but resident in Great Britain.  He has more than the required $50 and just like Esther, it is his first time in New York.  It looks like he is staying at 46 Pitt Street which is in the Lower East Side.  It isn’t clear whether he is visiting his brother-in-law, L Rosenzincief (or similar) or Joseph Smith.  My money is on Joseph Smith.  He is 5’ 5” tall with a dark complexion, grey hair and brown eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart wants to tell me this is the voyage where my great grandparents met for the first time and fell in love, and Eva was conceived on board ship in the middle of the great Atlantic ocean.  The voyage lasted 15 nights so they might have been able to squeeze all that in, especially if they didn’t suffer from sea-sickness.  Then my head just yells “not enough evidence” at me.  Sometimes in life you have to follow your heart, and be prepared for the disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;esther-returns-to-new-york-without-eva&quot;&gt;Esther returns to New York without Eva.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This family research would be easier if I could get documents for both the outbound and inbound voyages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Esther Solomons arrives in New York on 5 October 1907&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther arrives back in New York on 5 October 1907 almost exactly one year after she first arrived.  She has left her 4 month old child with her mother and sailed from Southampton on 28 September 1907. I know this is my great grandmother because she names her mother and lists the address as the same one where Eva was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her name was originally written as Esther Lichtenstein and she is now married, however someone has crossed out the Lichtenstein and writtem Salemons (sic) above it.  She has also given her occupation as Wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1907/BLOG_19071005-US-PASSENGERS-esther-solomons_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Esther Solomons arrives in New York on 5 October 1907&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second page tells us her Husband paid for her ticket and she has $10 with her.  It also says Esther was in the USA before between 1907 and 1907.  That provides more evidence of it being Esther on the previous voyage.  It also informs us she returned in 1907 so she had spent a few months in the USA before returning home.  Somewhere there should be a passenger list for her trip back to England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to see she is returning to her husband where he is living at 45 1st Street which is in the Lower East Side of New York.  Although no marriage certificate is in sight, I have to assume Esther and Jack were married in New York during her last trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-to-canada&quot;&gt;Moving to Canada.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1907 passenger list is the last one I have found concerning Esther until 1921.  I already knew from the marriage certificate of their daughter, Eva, that Jack was not alive in 1926.  The person who identified the murdered body as Esther Solomons said he had known her since 1914 and she had married two or three years later, changing her name to Esther Killas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found an extracted death index of a Manhattan resident called Jacob Lichtenstein, who died on 22 March 1914 at the age of 44.  This puts the year of his birth around 1870, the same as John Lichtenstein.  Jacob Lichtenstein is buried in Union Field Cemetery, Ringwood, Queens County, New York.  It just so happens I will be in New York in summer 2020, so I can pay a visit to the grave and see if there is any reference to Esther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1921/BLOG_19210709-UK-INWARD-esther_killas.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Esther Solomons arrives in Liverpool as Esther Killas in 1921&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is the first of three documents regarding a journey Esther made from Canada to London. It is a UK incoming passenger list showing Esther arrived in Liverpool on 4 July 1921.  It says she intends staying at her mum’s house in 1 Regal Place, Whitechapel.  She gives her occupation as a Dressmaker and has also managed to shave a few years off her age from 39 to 31!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is she lists Canada as her country of last permanent residence, but England as her intended future permanent residence.  Could it be she intended to stay in England?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/1921/BLOG_19210929-UK-OUTWARD-esther_killas.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Esther Killas leaves Southampton for Canada in 1921&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Esther had planned to stay England when she arrived in July, she had changed her mind and set off back to Canada from Southampton on 29 September 1921.  She had everything the same as on her arrival except her intended future redidence was now Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a form 30A for her return to Canada, but the date of the sailing does not match that of her outward passenger list.  It has it as 29 August 1921 instead of 29 September 1921.  It is also interesting to see her age as nearly 32.  Her 40th birthday would have taken place on 25 September according to the Gregorian Calendar and 4 October 1921 according to the Jewish Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be the date on the Form 30 was wrong, the alternative being she came back again, which does seem unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn from the Form 30A of Esther returning home to her Husband and it looks like she is an Orthadox Jew.  Of most interest is it saying she previously came to Canada in May 1913 and lived in the Jackson Apartments in Vancouver.  Had Jack already died by then or had she left beforehand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this occasion she is returning to her husband, Harry Killas, at the address in Vancouver.  She has $500 Canadian with her, which is about £4,100 in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would have seen her 14 year old daughter in London, who would have just left school.  Her brother, Alexander, had died in action during the first world war and another brother returned home from the same conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image &quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-was-mr-killas&quot;&gt;Who was Mr Killas?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only managed to find one document which links Harry Killas and Esther and it is a US immigration document for a journey Harry made from Canada to Washington, Seattle in the USA on or about 24 March 1924.  It provides a good amount of information about Harry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a 35 year old Cook who was born in the town of Smyrna in Turkey in either 1888 or early 1889.  He is Greek and is 5 foot 7 inches tall with brown hair and blue eyes.  He says he lives in Prince Rupert and his nearest relative is his wife, Esther, who also lives in Prince Rupert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry has $200 dollars with him and this is his first visit to the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-final-years&quot;&gt;The final years&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are passenger lists which show Esther returned to the UK in 1925 and 1927.  I believe she also returned in 1926 to attend the marriage of her daughter, Eva to Mark Chemerofsky.  She is a witness on the marriage certificate.  The next we know of Esther after the visit is when she is found murdered in April 1928.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to her Canadian probate she had $10,000 Canadian in the bank which is worth about £80,000 in 2019.  Not bad for a Dressmaker born into one of the poorest streets in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day it is not known who murdered Esther in 1928 and her sister 17 years later in 1945.  I would love to know what might have driven Esther to live abroad away from her daughter, what she did for a living, why she ended up in Prince Rupert, Canada and of course who and why she was murdered.  There is also so little I know about Jack Lichtenstein, or was it Jacob or even John?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only recently started finding this information out and I hope to discover more about Esther and Jack.  As a matter of coincidence, her daughter also married twice.  The first time to a Hairdresser, the second to a Cat Burglar known as “Greek Alf”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel there is more to come in the story of Esther and Jack, but for now I’ll leave it here with what I know already.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">My Mother was born on 7 February 1928 (16 Sh’vat 5688) in Bethnal Green, London and about two months later on 17 April 1928 (27 Nisan 5688) her grandmother, Esther Solomons, was brutally murdered nearly 5,000 miles away in Prince Rupert, British Colombia, Canada.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/esther_and_kitty_solomons_graves.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/esther_and_kitty_solomons_graves.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Where’s Grandma</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/07/31/wheres-grandma.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where's Grandma" /><published>2019-07-31T22:46:40+01:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T22:46:40+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/07/31/wheres-grandma</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/07/31/wheres-grandma.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a photo of Eva Lichtenstein, who was my maternal Grandmother who I never met.  She is Jewish. I learned my Mum was Jewish from my Dad when I was about 9 years old.  Mum had always been too scared to mention it to anyone just in case they turned against her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was concerned when I ended up in the German half at school designating it as the foreign language for me to learn, rather than French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Mum was 11 years old when she was evacuated from London at the start of World War 2 and was 17 when it ended in 1945.  Germany was the very last country in the world she would ever want to go to.  It was a fear she lived with all her adult life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine how that felt for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now her secret was out, I was full of questions and she was full of stories and a few vague answers.  She provided quite a few short anecdotes about people and places, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/10/20/hannah-and-jacob-solomons.html&quot;&gt;Hannah Solomons&lt;/a&gt;, who was her Great Grandmother and her Mum, Eva Lichtenstein, were the two she missed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was an 8 year old girl when Hannah died in January 1937, but she last saw her Mother in 1949 and always wanted to know what happened to her.  Finding my Grandma was what started me off in Family History research, but I never applied myself as much as I could have done.  Unfortunately my Mum died in 2004 and never knew what had become of her Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-many-aunts-so-few-names&quot;&gt;So many Aunts, so few names?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to my Mum talk about her life, you would be forgiven for thinking she had many Aunties.  The truth be told she had none.  Some were Great Aunts, some other relations and I suspect some were people she respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the Aunt she lived with in Long Acre who witnessed a murder.  An Aunt Bessy from Prince Rupert in Canada who visited a few times, but was murdered in Prince Rupert. Another Aunt who lived in Colvestone Crescent in Dalston, often buying Lox and Cream Cheese Bagels from the Ridley Road bakery at the end of the street.  I musn’t forget the paranoid Aunt who lived south of the river as well as the one in Lambeth.  Some of these people could well be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also had friends and occasionally gave them a name, but most people she told me about had places and stories but not names. At least not ones I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time my Dad announced Mum was Jewish, he also told me she had thought her name was Jacqueline Morris, which is the name on their Marriage certificate.  They found out it was Chemerofsky when they tried to emigrate to Australia.  We spent about 3 years and 3 months living in Australia but came back mostly because my Mum didn’t settle there.  She was homesick for a country where she had lost contact with her family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia turned out to be traumatic due to a German family out there.  It really stressed Mum out and when our feet touched the tarmac at Gatwick, I’m sure she bent down and kissed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did eventually manage to drag a few names out of Mum, did a little bit of research in the 1980s and 1990s, put it aside and got on with my life.  I tried again in 2009, but the desire wasn’t met by action.  Then various events leading up to a time in 2018 when the desire to learn more about where I came from and to actually find out where my Grandmother was took over me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have concentrated on the Jewish side and particularly the female line.  I also wanted to learn more about Jews, after all I am half-Jewish, and although I have yet to step inside a Synagogue, I feel a strong affinity with that part of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that Journey I have read some of Simon Schama’s books (more than once), read My Jewish Learning site regularly, have Esther Ansell as my favourite fictional heroine and regulary read The Eternal Dissident as well as soak up information about Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have uncovered lots of stories about my family and will try and write them up on this blog.  If you are thinking about looking into your family history, please don’t do what I did.  Please ask lots of questions of your relatives, write lots of notes and better still record conversations with them.  Try and get names and places and dates.  Ask the same question in different ways at different times.  This can trigger additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously began my research based on the following notes, which I have also reproduce as they were on the now fading paper I still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began with wanting to know what happened to my Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, and have ended up learning far more than I expect about my Jewish family and myself.  There are still gaps and questions and although I’ve hardly begun, it’s been a roller coaster of emotion at times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barrie Callender</name></author><summary type="html">This is a photo of Eva Lichtenstein, who was my maternal Grandmother who I never met.
