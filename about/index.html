<p>Thank you for your interest in learning about the author of this blog. My name is Barrie Callender and I am a freelancer mostly working with Oracle Primavera products as a Project Management System Implementation Consultant.</p>

<p>I am the owner of Workpattern Limited.</p>

<p>You can contact me via email me at <a href="mailto:barrie@callenb.org">barrie@callenb.org</a> or through twitter on <a href="https://twitter.com/callenb" rel="noopener">@callenb</a>.</p>

<p>Now the introduction is over, we should get to know each other. I’ll start by telling you a little about me.</p>

<p>At most places where I work, I often end up being called the <strong>Primavera P6 Guru</strong> or something similar. I started a <a href="https://usingprimavera.com" rel="noopener">site about Oracle Primavera</a> which was full of good intentions but very little content as of today.  I’m not sure what to do with that site but if I do blog about Primavera it will be at the site of my former employer <a href="https://tensix.com" rel="noopener">Ten Six Consulting</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ive-been-feeling-restless-for-a-while">I’ve been feeling restless for a while</h3>

<p>I’ve been in and around Project Management since 1987 and I’m ready for a change. I have always been interested in software development and as much as I enjoy the world of project consulting, I believe I would be happier writing software for a living.</p>

<p>I never intended to be involved in Project Management, but somehow landed a job supporting Artemis 2000 in November 1987. That was for Metier Management systems where I stayed for 13 years and four takeovers. I then spent 5 years at Pinnacle Management Systems Inc and a further 10 at what became <a href="https://tensix.com/" rel="noopener">Ten Six Consulting</a>.</p>

<p>I left Ten Six Consulting and started a contract in June 2016.  It ended 3 months later and my next contract started in October 2016 and I’ve been keeping busy ever since.  I’ve been doing this for some time and I do enjoy it, particularly the people I work with at my clients.  More and more of late I find I am asking myself what if I would enjoy doing something else more?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-blog-about">What is this blog about?</h2>

<p>I don’t want to make promises I can’t keep about big plans and big ideas so I’m mostly going to see what this blog is about after I’ve written a few posts.</p>

<p>I imagine the first few posts will be about things I have found useful and don’t want to forget.  Putting them on a blog means I’ll know where to go to get them back again.</p>

<p>If I get to 10 or 20 articles I’ll come back here and update what this site is about because I should have some idea by then.</p>

<p>I hope you find the articles of interest and return again in the future.  Please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p>All the very best for 2019 and beyond</p>
