## Searching for Grandma rebooted

I originally set out to rewrite the first post on this site, but ended up writing the fullest story I have today about my search for my Grandmother Eva Lichtenstein.

Here goes.

My Dad was brought up in the non-Conformist tradition in Stockton-on-Tees, when it was in county Durham, and my Mum was brought up as a Jewess in Whitechapel, London.  The photograph at the top of this post is of my maternal Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein.  It was touched up from a badly creased and torn sepia photograph my Mum kept with her.  Mum and Eva had an argument over the whereabouts of a ring around 1949/50, after which Eva disappeared from her life.

Mum always wanted to find out what happened to Eva, and I promised to do some research.  I did try once or twice, but without really knowing how to go about it.  The Internet in the 1980s wasn't what it is today, which didn't help either.

Mum died in 2004 without ever knowing what happened to her Mother, which means I hadn't made good on my promise.  However, in the last couple of years, from around the age of 55, I took a greater interest in my maternal ancestry because of the rise of antisemitism in the world at large, and the [Labour Party](https://labour.org.uk/), of which I am a member, in particular.  I'd recently rejoined, though not particularly active, and the rise of antisemitism and the way it is accomodated by some members remains shocking.

It lead me to want to understand what it meant to be Jewish, which then lead me to wanting to find out about my Jewish ancestry, and to answer the question I had failed to answer earlier.  Where's Grandma?

The Internet was now fully under way, and with notes I had written with my Mum in the 1980s, I began the quest to piece together my Family History, concentrating on my Jewish ancestors.  Nearly two years down the line and I can honestly say nothing would have prepared me for what I have discovered so far.  I started this blog in a hope I can find the words to tell the stories.

There are moments in all our lives when we remember exactly where we were and what we were doing.  My Mum would certainly have listed VE Day and President John F. Kennedy being assasinated.  I remember when I found out she was Jewish.

## Your Mum's Jewish

I can't count the number of times I walked to our allottment with my Dad, it was a lot.  We'd set off from our house at 77 Hind Street in Stockton-on-Tees, walk past where my Dad grew up at number 48 with the brass step, then to the bottom of the street and down the steps to Oxbridge Lane.

![My Father at the allottment in about 1972/73](/images/people/george-callender-57yo400x594.jpg){:class="img-left"}
We'd walk under the railway along Oxbridge Lane, passed our school, over the zebra crossing, and towards the cemetery, turning right at the roundabout and finally up Oxbridge Avenue to our destination.  All in all it was about a mile.

There was plenty of time to talk about all sorts of things, and we did.  On this one ocassion when I was about 9, we were talking about my Mum, and Dad was saying she worries a lot and we all needed to look after her.  Then he said she was often scared, and it is because she is Jewish, but she wouldn't want anyone to know.

I was 9 years old, always been to non-Conformist churches and now suddenly I'm half-Jewish.  I had a few questions to ask, especially why Mum didn't want anyone to know about something I distinctly remember thinking was quite exciting.

It turns out there are a lot of people who don't like Jews.  If my Mum was Jewish then there was a good chance I was too, so I needed to know about being Jewish, but my Dad knew about as much as I did.  He did tell me my Mum always thought her maiden name was Morris, and that is what appears on their marriage certificate, however her parents had changed their name soon after they were married.  I started to ask my Mum questions when we got back home, but it was about 10 years before she began to open up, and then it was just little cracks.


## Who are my Grandparents?

I asked Mum about my Grandparents, which is when I found out the last time my Mum had seen my Grandmother was about 1949, possibly a year or so later.  My Mum had received a letter from the Police Commisioner in Prince Rupert, Canada, advising of a ring being left to her by an Aunt Bessy, who my Mum said had disturbed some burglars and been murdered by them.  The ring was worth £300 to £500.  

Aunt Bessy was well known and liked by my Mum who enjoyed her visits when she came over to London from Prince Rupert.  Mum said Bessy had no children of her own, and treated Eva like a daughter.  

The ring had never been received by my Mum, but my Grandmother didn't believe her. They fell out, and soon afterwards my Grandmother disappeared along with the man she was living with, Alfred Purchase, who was a Cat Burglar known as Greek Alf.

My Mum always regretted falling out with my Grandmother.  She had just two photos from her past life, one was a photo of herself as a 4 year old and the other was a well-worn photo of her Mum.  My eldest brother arranged for this photo to be reconstructed, as you can see above, and she cried when we gave it to her.

## Growing up and getting married

So how much do I now know about my Grandmother?  She was born on 7th June 1907 (25th Sivan 5667) at 22 Fulbourne Street, Whitechapel. At the time, this street included the part of Durward Street between the present day Fulbourne Street and Vallance Road.  I believe the house where Eva was born was in the Durward Street part.  It was the home of Eva's Grandmother who is called Hannah Solomons, and as far as I can make out, came to England from Eastern Europe some time before April 1880.

<figcaption>My Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein's Birth Certificate</figcaption>

Eva's mother was Hannah's eldest child called Esther Solomons, and born in Little Patternoster Row, Spitalfields on 25th September 1881 (2nd Tishrei 5642).  Her father was a Tailor called Jack Lichtenstein, and Esther was a Dressmaker.

Esther had travelled to New York 9 months before Eva was born, leaving as a single woman on 25th September 1906  (6th Tishrei 5667) and returning in the first half of 1907, married and pregnant.  She then left for New York in the September following Eva's birth.  It is not known if Jack was in England for the birth of his daughter.

It seems Eva was brought up by her Grandmother, as the English Census of April 1911 has her living at 1 Regal Place with Hannah Solomons.  This road was off Old Montague Close, and lead up to the back of [The Pavilion Theatre](http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PavilionTheatreAndWonderlandWhitechapelRoad.htm).  Eva is 4 years old and Hannah's three youngest daughters, Rachael, Dinah and Rebecca are also living there.  Two other people are registered, one is a lodger and the other is Hannah's daughter-in-law named Cissie or Bessie Solomons.  Her husband is not there, but someone of the same name is in Wormwood Scrubs prison.  I expect it is him.  Esther is nowhere in sight and I suspect she has been living abroad in New York all this time.

<figcaption>1911 Census for 1 Regal Place, Old Montague Street</figcaption>
</figure>

I found out Aunt Bessy was Esther's younger sister called Kitty.  She was 17 when Eva was born, and she probably treated Eva like a daughter because she quite likely looked after Eva in her first few years.  Esther and Kitty were the two eldest daughters in the family and I suspect they were close.

Imagine being Eva, growing up without your parents and being brought up by your Grandmother and Aunts.  Even assuming Esther sent letters, and travelled back every so many years, it must have been difficult for her. Skype, Zoom, Facebook and the like didn't exist in those days.

The next document, I have found about Eva, is her marriage certificate which has Esther as a witness of her marriage to Marks Chemerofsky on 10th June 1926 (28th Sivan 5686).  Eva is a Milliner, and Marks is a Hairdresser.  Together, they are my Grandparents.  My Mum told me Eva was married in June near her birthday, and she wore a diamond in the back of each shoe.  Mum was surprised when I showed her a copy of the marriage certificat, as she didn't know it had taken place on the same day in June as I was born 37 years later.  It also showed Esther's husband, Jack Lichtenstein, as being deceased.

I found out from a second cousin, I came into contact through this research, of some of the national newspapers running a story on the wedding day about the capture of a man called Sidney Morris on the preceeding day.  He'd ingeniously escaped from Pentonville Prison the previous October and evaded capture for 9 months.  He went by several names, but the name on his birth certificate is Solomon Chemorowski, and he was my Grandfather's elder brother, and therefore my great uncle.

I'd like to think he was planning on going to their wedding.

## The early years of my Mum's life

My Mum was born nearly 2 years later on 7th February 1928 (16 Sh'vat 5688), whilst the family was living at 3 Clarkston Street, Bethnal Green, London.  She is named Jacqueline Schemerofsky on her birth certificate.  She told me the family soon moved to a Dairy at 56 Vallance Road, which her Mum later changed into a Milliners.  She also said her parents were seperated in 1931 and my Mum went to live with her Great Grandmother, Hannah Solomons in 1 Regal Place.  Apparently her father liked to drink and gamble and that is why her parents marriage broke up.

I think there is a lot of truth in this account, but I think things started to get messy a few months after my Mum was born.  An event took place two months after my Mum was born, and one I don't think she ever knew about.  

Esther Solomons had moved to Prince Rupert in 1913, and two or three years later she got married to Harry Killas.  Esther had visited London in 1925, 1926 and 1927.  About 2 months after my Mum was bornn February 1928, Esther was brutally murdered in her home on Comox Avenue in Prince Rupert.  It was 17th April 1928 (27th Nisan 5688), and was almost exactly 17 years to the day before her younger sister was murdered, not only in the same city, but less than a block away in the same street.  The circumstances of both murders were very similar.

Esther had been born in one of the poorest streets in Whitechapel, yet she left over £10,000 in her will to Eva, including some shares and a fishing boat.

The Electoral Register shows Max and Eva Morris living at 1 Regal Place in 1929, and this shows they had changed their names soon after my Mum was born.  The following year has Max and Eva Morris living at 1 Regal Place and 56 Vallance Road.  In both cases, Max qualifies through his occupation.  It seems odd to have two entries in the Electoral Register for the same year, but that may well be my ignorance. 

The 1930 electoral register goes up to November 1931, and coincides with the time my Mum said her parents seperated.  I'm not sure how long Eva and my Mum lived in 56 Vallance Road, but I suspect it wasn't much more than a year.  I have a theory where Eva invested her inheritance into a business and Marks lost some of it gambling. 

Mum also tells a story of her father breaking into her room one night and stealing her away from the Dairy in Vallance Road.  After her parents seperated my Mum was brought up by Hannah Solomons, just as Eva was before her.  They lived at 1 Regal Place, two doors down from Harry Levenson who was [the first Bookmaker in Spitalfields](https://spitalfieldslife.com/2013/01/27/harry-levenson-bookmaker/).  Hannah's maiden name was Levinson, and with the inconsistency around spelling names, there is a possibility they were related.  I have been in correspondence with Harry's son, and sadly we have found no evidence to suggest they were related.  I believe Hannah had lived in 1 Regal Place since 1909, when the previous resident fell out of a window and killed herself while sleep walking.

I don't know where Eva was when my Mum was growing up.  The few stories she told about her early childhood included Hannah, but not Eva.  It was Hannah that took her to Victoria Park, asking Jewish boys "Bist du fruum", and getting them to take my Mum out on the lake in a boat.

There is one story Mum told so many times, I feel like I was there.  On the 4th January 1937 (21st Tevet 5697), Hannah and my Mum were alone in the house at Regal Place.  Mum was going to be 9 in a month's time, so she was just 8 years old.  Hannah was sitting in her armchair, and my Mum was next to her.  She was holding her hand and stroking it whilst speaking softly to Hannah as she drifted out of this life.  The telling of this story never failed to make Mum cry, and she always ended it with "I loved my Great Grandmother".

After Hannah died, my Mum said she was pushed from pillar to post, as she went from one Aunt to the next until she was evacuated when war broke out.  She said she went to Exmouth, and sure enough there is a Jacqueline Morris living there according to the 1939 Register.  The name "CALLENDER" has been written next to her in green ink.

She was 11 years old when she was evacuated, and like many who were, she returned home to London about two years later.  She was working as a waitress when the war in Europe ended.  She was in contact with Eva, and has told me Eva was in prison at the start of the war.

Anecdotes paint a picture of Eva having a colourful life.  She said Eva was a Madam known as "Jewish Betty" or "Black Betty".  My Mum often mentioned Eva had been the witness to a murder in Long Acre, London at the home of a wealthy Aunt.  My notes contain the following:

> At some point in her life, Eva was witness to a murder but didn't turn up to the trial.  Someone she knew called Dora(?) who lived in Long Acre was the victim in the west end.

The lady in question was known as [Russian Dora](http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=1275) and it remains one of a number of unsolved murders in the west-end at the time.  It took place in September 1948 at 126 Long Acre.  Her real name was Helen Freedman or Freeman, and she had been on the Electoral Register there since 1945.  Despite what my Mum says there was no trial.  I suppose there may have been an inquest,  

Mum and Eva parted company a couple of years after Dora was murdered.

## After the split

When I was looking for evidence of where my Mum may have lived, I came across an entry in the Electoral Register for her living at 126 Long Acre in 1952.  I also know my Mum lived at 50 Colvestone Crescent, Dalston with an Aunt.  They'd often have Lox and Cream Cheese bagels for breakfast from Ridley Road bakery.  I now know the Aunt was a lady called Abigail Bloomfield, and she is registerred living at 126 Long Acre from 1945 to 1952, and then at 50 Colvestone Crescent from 1954 to 1960.  My Mum also being on the register at 50 Colvestone Crescent in 1956 and 1957.

It seems to me, my Mum was quite close to Eva and Eva's friends, as I suspect Abigail and Dora were.  I don't believe Mum knew Dora.  Eva had left her life by the time she was living in Long Acre.

I knew Alfred Percy Purchase and Eva were living together in Darling Row, Bethnal Green when Eva and Mum fell out, and hoping they had got married, I searched for their marriage in the registries.  This was recently, long after Mum had died.  I ordered a marriage certificate where the names appear as Alfred Percy Purchase and Elizabeth Lichstein.  The father of the bride is listed as Jack Lichtenstein, which points to this being Eva.

<figure markdown="1">

<figcaption>Marriage Certificate for Alfred Purchase and Elizabeth Lichtenstein</figcaption>
</figure>

The date of their wedding was 2nd October 1958 (18 Tishrei 5719) and it took place in Southampton.  Reading that certificate was enough to make me shed a tear.  My parents were married about 5 months later, and a mere 15 miles away, on 21st February 1959 (13th Adar I 5719) in nearby Portsmouth.  I thought of my Mum wonderring what had happened to her own Mother, and her being a mere 15 miles or so away.

Having found Eva and Alfred's marriage certificate, and knowing she was using Elizabeth Purchase as her own name, I was able to search for and get a copy of her death certificate.  Eva died on 8th December 1985 (25th Kislev 5746) in Tynings Nursing Home, 32 Albert Road, Clevedon, Avon.  Nowadays this is divided into two homes.  Alfred is the informant and he was living at 15, Hastings Road, Bedminster, Bristol.  Eva's maiden name is listed as "Lichenstein".

In an earlier post, [On finding Grandma](/2019/12/01/on-finding-grandma.html), I tell how I found Eva was cremated at South Bristol Crematorium and where her ashes are scattered.

So far in my research, I have come into contact with a number of people who are willing to provide information and help me.  The first is a second cousin on my Grandfather's side who has been a tremendous help.  Recently I had a "conversation" with a fellow [Ancestry](http://ancestry.co.uk) user who had read about Eva in a family history book written by his cousin.  I am trying to get hold of a copy as it may contain information about her after she and Mum parted company.

# The end of the beginning

When I rebooted this research a couple of years ago, I thought I might be able to find a death certificate for Eva, and know where she was buried or cremated.  That was it.  I never thought I would end up writing about it anywhere, or have more stories to find out about and tell.  I have hinted about some of the stories here and have several lines of research I am following, which I hope to publish in articles on here in this small site of mine.

There is a lot of murder going on in this family.  My Great Grandmother Esther, Great Aunt Kitty, and Russian Dorah are known so far.  Strictly speaking, Dorah is not part of my family, as far as I know, but there is a connection.

Once this virus starts to subside, I hope to pay a visit to Eva in South Bristol Cemetery.  I will take flowers, and my son has said he will come with me.

In the meantime, there are more letters and emails to write, more research to be done, and hopefully more posts to publish.
