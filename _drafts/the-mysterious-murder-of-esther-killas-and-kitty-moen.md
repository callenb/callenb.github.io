Esther Killas and Kitty Moen were sisters who lived in different houses on Comox Avenue in Prince Rupert, British Colombia.

Esther Killas was murdered in her home at 857 Comox Avenue on 17th April 1928.  Her throat was virtually slashed from ear to ear, the lights were left on, the house keys missing and money had not been stolen.

Kitty Moen was mudered in her home at 817 Comox Avenue on 15th April 1945. She was stabbed through the heart, the radio and stoves were left on, the house was locked and money had not been stolen.

The houses were a few doors apart on the same side of the street.  The murders took place almost exactly 17 years apart.

This is of interest to me because Esther Killas is my Great Grandmother and Kitty was her younger sister.  My Mum knew Kitty, although I have written her name down in my notes as Aunt Bessy.

Here are the notes I wrote in the 1980s about Kitty and Esther.

The murder of Esther was a big event when it took place and [Sue Harper](http://sueharperphotography.com/) has included a section about the murder of Esther in her book, [When a Bad Wind Blows: 10 Tragic Events in the History of Prince Rupert](http://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?contributorId=216916).  The reason for their murder remains unsolved.

In this blog post I will provide what I know about these two sisters from the records they left behind and why I know Esther Killas and Kitty Moen were born Esther and Kitty Solomons, and Esther is my Great Grandmother.

## Children Of The Ghetto

Esther Ansell is now one of my favourite fictional characters.  She is the heroine of Israel Zangwill's book [Children of the Ghetto A Study of a Peculiar People](https://amzn.to/319oHh1).  It is set in London's Whitechapel around the time my Great Grandmother was growing up.  It is a very good book and taught me a lot about many things including what it was like growing up in London's Whitechapel in the last couple of decades of the 19th century.

### Birth of Esther Solomons
{% img /images/1881/BTH-18810925-Solomons_Esther.png 100% "Birth Certificate of Esther Solomons (25-Sep-1881 to 17-Apr-1928)" title:"Birth Certificate of Esther Solomons (25-Sep-1881 to 17-Apr-1928)" %}

Esther Solomons was born on 25th September 1881 (2nd Tishrei 5642), which was the 2nd day of Rosh Hashana, to Jacob and Hannah Solomons.  Her birth certificate has 12 Patternoster Row as the address where she was born, but it was clearly 12 Little Patternoster Row in Spitalfields.  In 1898 Charles Booth described [Little Patternoster Row](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/notebooks/b351#?cv=55&c=0&m=0&s=0&z=730.7679%2C528.5803%2C1243.3164%2C739.5) thus:
> 2 & 3 storey common lodging houses. Ragged women, children, holey toeless boots; windows dirty patched with brown paper and broken. Prostitutes, thieves and ponces. Buildings owned by the notorious Jack McCarthy of Dorset Street.

It was coloured black on his map and designated as "vicious, semi-criminal".  The birth certificate also shows the Solomons lived at 13 Crispen Street which unlike Little Patternoster Row still exists today.

The 1881 Census had taken place earlier that year in April but there is no entry for my Jacob and Hannah Solomons.  There is a Jacob and Hannah Solomons at 8 Little Patternoster Row but their ages are only one year apart. There are no Solomons living at 13 Crispen Street either.  My guess is they had recently arrived in London having fled from the Pogroms started around April of this year.  If that was the case, then Hannah must have travelled whilst she was pregnant.

### Birth of Kitty Solomons
{% img /images/1889/BTH-18891224-Solomons_kitty.png 100% "Birth Certificate of Kitty Solomons (24-Dec-1889 to 15-Apr-1945)" title:"Birth Certificate of Kitty Solomons (24-Dec-1889 to 15-Apr-1945)" %}

Kitty Solomons was born on 24th December 1889 (1 Tevet 5650), which was the second last day of Hanukkah.  The family were living in 2 Both Street Buildings.  Charles Booth has an entry on [Booth Street including Booth Street Buildings](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/notebooks/b351#?cv=80&c=0&m=0&s=0&z=-158.1989%2C-82.3889%2C2770.3977%2C1647.778) where I can't read every word but what I can he says:
>
> West along Booth St. ?, Jews, tailors, shoemakers, purple on map, on the south side are Booth St Bldgs. 4 storied, look very rough, ? very poor, all Jews, broken windows stuffed with rags, dirty, no curtains or blinds to windows only a bit of stuff drawn across lower half, ragged dark (?) children, no trouble to the police because the Jews are not men (?) enough to be rough!  Corners of the ? used as urinals, stench in hot weather.  there is a Superintendent but he never looks after anything, some prostitutes living here
>

Booth was writing about 11 years after Kitty was born, but it is likely the area may have been in a similar state when she was born.

Both Esther's and Kitty's Birth certificates have Jacob occupied as a Tailor, but they don't say what Hannah did for a living.  The family is living at 31 & 32 Booth Street Buildings according to the 1891 Census.  Jacob is 36 and Hannah is 29 and both are Tailor Machinists born in Russian Poland.  At 9 years of age, Esther is the oldest of their 5 children and Kitty is the youngest at 1.  The other three are boys Hyman (7), Louis (5) and Aleck (3).

### Growing Up
So far I haven't been able to find any school records for Esther.  I need to make a few journeys to Tower Hamlets and look through their records.  Last time I did that was in 1988 and I didn't really know what I was doing.

As for Kitty, I have found a record for her being admitted on 12th November 1900 at Garden Street Temporary School.  This school ran from 1893 to 1907 when it became Senrab School.  Garden Street no longer exists, but it was located next to Stepney Green Astro Turf where Crossrail is building the C360 Stepney Green Shaft. 

Her date of birth is stated as 25th December 1889, a day earlier than her birth certificate.  She was the only Kitty Solomons registerred in 1889 or 1890 and so I am certain it is her.  Christmas Eve and Christmas Day would not have been significant for a Jewish family.

Anna is in the *Name of Parent or Guardian*, which is just as good as Hannah, and the address is Stepney Green Buildings where it looks like they were living in 21 D Block.  Her father had died in 1898 which is why Hannah was registerring her.

The Census of 1901 sees the family living at 59 Nelson Street.  Jacob is no longer alive and so Hannah is bringing the children up by herself.  She has all her children living with her apart from Louis.  Esther is 17 and a Tailoress as is her 40 year old mother.  Her brother Hyman is a Caninet Maker and all the rest are at school.

They aren't the only people living at this address.  There is a 50 year old mother and her 30 year old son who is a Traveller.  I believe this may be another name for a hawker or travelling salesman.  They come from Russia and it looks like his first name is Simon, but I can't read their surname.  There is also a 60 year old Tailor called George Day and his wife Mary from Ireland.

### Where and when did Esther get married

At this moment in time, I am not sure when or where Esther got married.  My Mother said she was married to Jack or Jacob Lichtenstein, but I have never found such a record, and I have looked for Lichstein as well as other combinations.  

Jack Lichtenstein is the father and Esther Lichtenstein, formerly Solomons the mother on the birth certificate of my Grandmother Eva Lichtenstein.  She was born on 7th June 1907 (25th Sivan 5667).  The birth was registerred by Hannah Solomons.  This helps to tie the newly born Eva to Esther and then Esther to Hannah.  It also looks like Jack and Esther were living at 22 Fulbourne Street in Whitechapel with Hannah.

I am going to assume Jack and Esther were married before Eva was born.  As I mentioned earlier, I have never found a marriage in the indexes for Esther Solomons and Jacob (Jack) Lichtenstein.

### Esther and Kitty go missing for a few years
Hannah can be found in the 1911 Census living at 1 Regal Place, Old Montague Street.  This is an address my Mum has told me about as she lived there with Hannah until her death in January 1937.  The 1911 Census shows Hannah's three youngest daughters living with her.

Hannah is described as a Tailoress working at home.  Her daughter Rachel is a Tailoress as well, Dinah is a Furrier and Rebecca is at school.  The next resident is Eva Lichtenstein, her 4 year old Grand child.  I haven't been able to find Esther or Jack on any Census record and it seems they have vanished, leaving Eva in the hands of her mother.

I suspect they are abroad somewhere, but passenger list searches haven't turned up a Jacob and Esther Lichtenstein or variant that could be them.  The most recent dated record I have of them is where Jack Lichtenstein is listed as deceased on the marriage certificate of my Grandparents.  Jack was a Hairdresser, which is what my Grandfather was too.

### Was Aunt Bessy actually my Grandmother?
My Mum and Grandmother fell out over a ring Aunt Bessy had supposedly left my Mum in her will.  My Mum never received the ring, but my Grandmother didn't believe her and they fell out over it.  My Mum had said Aunt Bessy came over from Canada and treated her Mother as if she was one of her own.

It was at this point I had a wild idea that Aunt Bessy was actually my Great Grandmother.  To that end I started searching for Solomons travelling to Canada.

### Esther's journey's between Canada and England
My search now concentrated on Esther where I found records of Esther travelling backwards and forwards between England and Canada.  My Mother never knew her Grandmother so I had assumed she had died before she was old enough to remember her.

There is a lot of interesting information on the passenger lists and other documents, which I will come back to.  In the mean time here is the list of sailing records I have for Esther.  The first one in 1906 was the last one I found.

* Esther Solomons departed Liverpool on 25th September 1906 bound for New York.
* Esther Killas arrived in Liverpool, England from Quebec, Canada on 4th July 1921.
* Esther Killas arrived in Quebec, Canada from Ecuador on 29th August 1921.  I'm assuming this is her return trip for the previous sailing.
* Esther Killas arrived in Quebec, Canada from Southampton, England having left there on 29th September 1921.
* Esther Killas left Southampton, England on 17th July 1925, arriving in Quebec, Canada on 26th July 1925.
* Esther Killas left Southampton, England on 22nd April 1927, arriving in Quebec, Canada on 30th April 1927.
* 29th April 1927, Kitty Moen departed Liverpool and arrived in Quebec Canada on 5th May 1927.

Esther Lichtenstein is the name of the witness on Eva's marriage certificate so she must have had a trip in 1926 as well.  Assuming that is the case, it means she visited England in 1925, 1926 and 1927.

The first travel record in the list is the last one I came across.  There is an Esther Solomons 5th from the bottom of it.  She is a 24 year old Dressmaker which up until just before I wrote this was only a possibility.  I just scanned down the list and I came across a 36 year old Hairdresser by the name of J. Lichtenstein.  Naturally I thought could this be my Great Grandfather?  I wanted to hope so because meeting on a voyage across the ocean is pretty romantic.  Then I noticed something which surely can't be a coincidence.  J Lichtenstein's ticket number is 49988 and if you add one to it you end up with 49989, which is the ticket number belonging to Esther Solomons.
