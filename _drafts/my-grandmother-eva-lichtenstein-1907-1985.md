## Searching for Grandma rebooted

My Dad was brought up in the non-Conformist tradition in Stockton-on-Tees, when it was in county Durham, and my Mum was brought up as a Jewess in Whitechapel, London.  The photograph at the top of this post is of my maternal Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein.  It was touched up from a badly creased and torn sepia photograph my Mum kept with her.  Mum and Eva had an argument over the whereabouts of a ring around 1949/50, after which Eva disappeared from her life for ever.

Mum always wanted to find out what happened to Eva, and I promised to do some research.  I did try once or twice, but without really knowing how to go about it.  The [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet) in the 1980s wasn't what it is today, which didn't help either.

Mum died in 2004 without ever knowing what happened to her Mother, which means I hadn't made good on my promise.  However, in the last couple of years, from around the age of 55, I took a greater interest in my maternal ancestry because of the rise of antisemitism in the world at large, and the [Labour Party](https://labour.org.uk/), of which I am a member, in particular.  I'd recently rejoined, though not particularly active, and the rise of antisemitism and the way it is accomodated by some members remains apalling.

It lead me to want to understand what it meant to be Jewish, which then lead me to wanting to find out about my Jewish ancestry, and to answer the question I had failed to answer earlier.  [Where's Grandma?](https://callenb.org/2019/07/31/wheres-grandma.html)

The Internet was now fully under way, and with notes I had written with my Mum in the 1980s, I began the quest to piece together my Family History, concentrating on my Jewish ancestors.  Nearly two years down the line and I can honestly say nothing would have prepared me for what I have discovered so far.  I started this blog in a hope I can find the words to tell the stories.

There are events that take place during our lives when we remember exactly where we were and what we were doing at the time.  My Mum would certainly have listed VE Day and President John F. Kennedy being assasinated.  I remember when I found out she was Jewish.

## Your Mum's Jewish

I can't count the number of times I walked to our allottment with my Dad, it was a lot.  We'd set off from our house at 77 Hind Street in Stockton-on-Tees, walk past where my Dad grew up at number 48 with the brass step, then to the bottom of the street and down the steps to Oxbridge Lane.

{% include image.html class="img-left" url="/images/people/george-callender-57yo400x594.jpg" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="My Father at the allottment in about 1972/73" %}
We'd walk under the railway along Oxbridge Lane, passed our school, over the zebra crossing, and towards the cemetery, turning right at the roundabout and finally up Oxbridge Avenue to our destination.  It was only about a mile but there was plenty of time to talk about all sorts of things, and we did.

On this one ocassion when I was about 9, we were talking about my Mum, and my Dad was saying she worries a lot and we all needed to look after her.  We, being Dad, myself and my two older brothers.  Then he said she was often scared, and it is because she is Jewish, but she wouldn't want anyone to know.

I was 9 years old, always been to non-Conformist churches and now suddenly I'm half-Jewish.  I had a few questions to ask, especially why Mum didn't want anyone to know about something I distinctly remember thinking was quite exciting.

It turns out there are a lot of people who don't like Jews.  If my Mum was Jewish then there was a good chance I was too, so I needed to know more about Jews, but my Dad knew about as much as I did.  He did tell me my Mum always thought her maiden name was Morris, the name on their marriage certificate, however her parents had changed their name soon after they were married.  I started to ask my Mum questions when we got back home, but it was about 10 years before she began to open up, and then it was just little cracks.

## Who are my Grandparents?

I asked Mum about my Grandparents, which is when I found out the last time my Mum had seen my Grandmother was about 1949, possibly a year or so later.  My Mum had received a letter from the Police Commisioner in Prince Rupert, Canada, advising of a ring being left to her by an Aunt Bessy, who my Mum said had disturbed some burglars and been murdered by them.  The ring was worth £300 to £500 which if true, would be about £10,000 to £17,000 pounds nowadays.  

Aunt Bessy was well known and liked by my Mum who enjoyed her visits when she came over to London from Prince Rupert.  Mum said Bessy had no children of her own, and treated Eva like a daughter.  At one stage I thought she might have been Eva's Mum.  

The ring had never been received by my Mum, but my Grandmother didn't believe her. They fell out, and soon afterwards my Grandmother disappeared along with the man she was living with, Alfred Purchase, a Cat Burglar from Bristol known as Greek Alf.

My Mum always regretted falling out with my Grandmother.  She had just two photos from her past life, one was a photo of herself when she was a 4 year old, and the other was a well-worn photo of her Mum.  My eldest brother arranged for this photo to be reconstructed, to what it is like in the photograph above, and she cried when we gave it to her.

## Growing up without her Mum!

So how much do I now know about my Grandmother?  Eva was born on 7th June 1907 (25th Sivan 5667) at 22 Fulbourne Street, Whitechapel. At the time, this street included the part of Durward Street between the present day Fulbourne Street and Vallance Road.  I believe the house where Eva was born was in the Durward Street part.  It was the home of Hannah Solomons, who was Eva's Grandmother.  My research indicates Hannah came to England from [Vishay, Lithania](https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/vishey/vishey1.html).  Hannah's husband, Jack Solomons, had died in 1898 from consumption, or [Tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis) as it is known today.

{% include image.html url="/images/1907/BTH-19070607-Eva_lichtenstein.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="My Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein's Birth Certificate" %}

Eva's mother was Esther Solomons and the eldest child of Hannah and Jack.  She was born at 12 Little Patternoster Row, Spitalfields on 25th September 1881 (2nd Tishrei 5642).  Eva's mother was a Dressmaker and her father was a Tailor called Jack Lichtenstein.

Esther had travelled to New York 9 months before Eva was born, leaving as a single woman on 25th September 1906  (6th Tishrei 5667) and returning in the first half of 1907, married and pregnant.  There was no Jack Lichtenstein on the ship, but there was a Hairdresser called John Lichtenstein from Hungary, with a ticket number of "49988", just 1 less than the ticket number "49989" held by Esther.  Nobody else had a ticket number even close to theirs, so I am guessing they knew each other, and John may actually have been Jack.

Esther then left for New York in September 1907 following Eva's birth.  I do not know if Jack was in England for the birth of his daughter, or if indeed there ever was a Jack.  The passenger list on arrival in New York has her Lichtenstein surname crossed out and "Salamons" written above it. I have not found a marriage certificate for Esther and Jack.

The evidence suggests Eva was brought up by her Grandmother whilst her Mum lived in New York or somewhere else in America.  The UK Census of April 1911 has Eva living at 1 Regal Place with Hannah Solomons.  This is an address I know very well, because my Mum also lived there with Hannah.  It was a street which came off Old Montague Close, and lead up to the back of [The Pavilion Theatre](http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PavilionTheatreAndWonderlandWhitechapelRoad.htm).  Eva is 4 years old and Hannah's three youngest daughters, Rachael, Dinah and Rebecca are also living there.  Two other people are registered, one is a lodger and the other is Hannah's daughter-in-law named Cissie or Bessie Solomons.  Her husband is not there, but someone of the same name is in Wormwood Scrubs prison.  I expect it is him.  There is no sign of Esther and I believe she was most likely living abroad in New York.

{% include image.html url="/images/1911/CENSUS_SUM_1911_Hannah_Solomons_1_Regal_Place.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="1911 Census for 1 Regal Place, Old Montague Street, E1" %}

After Esther left in 1907, the next passenger list featuring her name is in 1921.  She travelled back to London quite frequently after that.  I am hopeful she did so during the whole of Eva's life, and I simply haven't found the passenger list confirming it.  There must have been letters too, but sadly I will be very surprised if I ever come across them.

I have found no records about Eva as she was growing up.  She would have been 7 at the outbreak of WWI in 1914.  I know all three of the uncles on her Mum's side, served in the armed forces, and unfortunately one did not return home.  I also know Aunt Bessie, who was actually Eva's Aunt Kitty, visited Esther in 1921 after Esther had moved to Canada in 1913.  Kitty would have been 17 when Eva was born.  When my Mum said she treated Eva like a daughter, it may have been because she quite likely looked after Eva in her early years when Esther was abroad.  Esther and Kitty were the two eldest daughters in the family and they must have been close to each other.

I find it hard to imagine being Eva, growing up without parents, and brought up by a Grandmother and Aunts.  Even assuming Esther sent letters, and travelled back when she could, it must have been difficult for Eva.

## Getting married, giving birth and suffering loss

The next document, I have found about Eva, is her marriage certificate which has her Mum, Esther, as a witness of her marriage to Marks Chemerofsky on 10th June 1926 (28th Sivan 5686).  Eva is a Milliner, and Marks is a Hairdresser.  Together, they are my Grandparents.

My Mum told me Eva was married in June near her birthday, and she wore a diamond in the back of each shoe.  What my Mum didn't know, until I showed her a copy of the marriage certificate, was the marriage took place exactly 37 years before I was born on 10th June 1963 (18 Sivan 5723).  I also know from the marriage certificate that Jack had died.

{% include image.html url="/images/1926/MAR-19260610_Mark_Chemeroofsky_and_Eva_Lichtenstein.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Marriage certificate of Mark Chemerofsky and Eva Lichtenstein" %}

It's often interesting to look back at what was in the news on special ocassions like birthdays and marriages.  On Eva's wedding day, some of the national newspapers ran a story about the capture of a man called Sidney Morris on the day before.  He'd ingeniously escaped from Pentonville Prison the previous October, and evaded capture for 9 months.  He went by several names, but the name on his birth certificate is Solomon Chemorowski, and he was my Grandfather's elder brother, and so was my great uncle.

Personally, I'd like to think he was planning on going to their wedding.  If that was the case, then I suspect it may have affected the ocassion.

My Mum was born nearly 2 years later on 7th February 1928 (16 Sh'vat 5688), whilst the family was living at 3 Clarkston Street, Bethnal Green, London.  She is named Jacqueline Schemerofsky on her birth certificate.  She told me the family soon moved to a Dairy at 56 Vallance Road, which her Mum later changed into a Milliners.  She also said her parents were seperated in 1931 and my Mum went to live with her Great Grandmother, Hannah Solomons in 1 Regal Place.  

Apparently Marks liked to drink, gamble with cards, and generally go out enjoying himself.  My Mum considerred his behaviour the main reason for my Grandparent's marriage breaking up.  Marks eventually married a lady called Florence May Dix in 1941, who he had been living with, according to the Electoral Register, since 1936.

{% include image.html url="/images/1928/BTH-19280207_Jacqueline_Shamirofsky.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Birth certificate of my Mother, Jacqueline Shamerofsky" %}

Whereas there is plenty of truth to this view, I'm sure there was more to it than my Grandfather's behaviour, and it involved Eva's Mum, Esther.  I am certain my own Mum had no knowledge of what happened.

Esther Solomons, had moved to Prince Rupert, Canada, in 1913, and two or three years later she got married to a Norwegion called Harry Killas.  Esther had visited London in 1925, 1926 for the wedding, and again in 1927.  She never visited in 1928 when her only Grand-daughter was born.  The truth is she wasn't able to come over because she was brutally murdered in her home on Comox Avenue, Price Rupert, Canada.

It was 17th April 1928 (27th Nisan 5688), and was almost exactly 17 years to the day before Kitty, who left the ring to my Mum, was murdered.  Not only was Kitty murdered in the same city, but she was murdered in the same street, less than a block away from Esther's home.  There are similarities between the murders, Esther's is told in a book and Kitty's appeared as the most significant case in the British Colombia annual police report.  Both murders are unsolved.

It was a big shock to me when I found this out, so it must have been a huge blow to Eva.  A 20 year old woman, with a two month old baby, and her Mother is taken away from her in an unthinkable manner.  The probrate record shows Eva inherrited some $14,000 Canadian dollars worth of assets including a fishing boat, shares and about $10,000 in cash.

## Seperation

The Electoral Register shows Max and Eva Morris living at 1 Regal Place in 1929, which implies they had changed their names soon after my Mum was born.  Copying Marks' brother Sidney's name change, which is based on the name of their father.  The following year has Max and Eva Morris living at 1 Regal Place and 56 Vallance Road.  In both cases, Max qualifies through his occupation.  I'm guessing Eva would have received her inheritance by this time and they leased the Dairy.

I wouldn't be surprised if Eva tried to start a business with the money she inherrited after the murder of Esther.  This may have fallen apart for a number of reasons including Max's card gambling.  Mum also tells a story of her father breaking into her bedroom in Vallance Road, one night and taking her away.

The 1930 Electoral Register goes up to November 1931, and coincides with the time my Mum said her parents seperated.  I'm not sure how long Eva and my Mum lived in 56 Vallance Road, but I suspect it wasn't much more than a year or two.  My Mum has said she didn't live with her parents after they seperated, having moved to 1 Regal Place with Hannah Solomons.  History repeating itself, sees my 4 year old Mum living apart from her Mother, just as we saw 4 year old Eva doing the same in 1911, and in the same house with the same ancestor.

I don't know where Eva was when my Mum was growing up.  The few stories she told about her early childhood included Hannah, but not Eva.  It was Hannah that took her to Victoria Park, asking Jewish boys "Bist du fruum", to get one of them to take my Mum out on the lake in a boat on Saturday.

There is one story Mum told so many times, I feel like I was there.  On the 4th January 1937 (21st Tevet 5697), Hannah and my Mum were alone in the house at Regal Place.  Mum was going to be 9 in a month's time, so she was just 8 years old.  Hannah was sitting in her armchair, and my Mum was next to her.  She is holding her hand and stroking it whilst speaking softly to Hannah as she drifted out of this life.  The telling of this story never failed to make Mum cry, and she always ended it with "I loved my Great Grandmother".

After Hannah died, my Mum said she was pushed from pillar to post, as she went from one Aunt to the next until she was evacuated when war broke out.  She said she went to Exmouth, and sure enough there is a Jacqueline Morris living there according to the 1939 Register.  The name "CALLENDER" has been written next to her in green ink.

## Back in London

Mum was 11 years old when she was evacuated, and like many evacuees, she returned home to London about two years later.  She was working as a waitress in Piccadilly when the war in Europe ended.  She was in contact with Eva, and has told me Eva was in prison at the start of the war.  This could explain why she has not been found in the 1939 Register.  Prisoners often had just their initials entered.

Anecdotes from my Mum painted a picture of Eva having a colourful life.  My Mum used to go out with my Grandmother who knew all sorts of people.  She came into contact with many different kinds of people, and she accepted everyone.  Mum once revealed Eva was a Madam known as "Jewish Betty" or "Black Betty".  She also told how Eva had been the witness to a murder in Long Acre, London at the home of a wealthy Aunt.  Reading the notes I took when speaking with her, they say:

> At some point in her life, Eva was witness to a murder but didn't turn up to the trial.  Someone she knew called Dora(?) who lived in Long Acre was the victim in the west end.

The lady in question was known as [Russian Dora](http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=1275) and it remains one of a number of unsolved murders of prostitutes in the west-end at the time.  It took place in September 1948 at 126 Long Acre.  Her real name was Helen Freedman or Freeman, and she had been on the Electoral Register there since 1945.  Despite what my Mum says there was no trial.  I suppose there may have been an inquest, or maybe Eva just didn't tell the police what she knew.  There were rumours of a gangland element to it which may have made my Grandmother hesitant to come forward.

Mum and Eva parted company a couple of years after Dora was murdered.

## After the split

When I was looking for evidence of where my Mum may have lived, I came across an entry in the Electoral Register for her living at 126 Long Acre in 1952.  I also know my Mum lived at 50 Colvestone Crescent, Dalston with an Aunt.  They'd often have Lox and Cream Cheese bagels for breakfast from Ridley Road bakery.  I am now certain the Aunt was a lady called Abigail Bloomfield. She is registerred living at 126 Long Acre from 1945 to 1952, and then at 50 Colvestone Crescent from 1954 to 1960.  My Mum also being on the register at 50 Colvestone Crescent in 1956 and 1957.

It seems to me, my Mum was quite close to Eva and Eva's friends, as I suspect Abigail and Dora were, if not related.  Dora was supposed to have come to London from Lithuania when she was 16.  I don't believe Mum knew Dora.

I knew Alfred Percy Purchase and Eva were living together in Darling Row, Bethnal Green when Eva and Mum fell out.  Mum tells the story of a visit to their flat, when the police knocked on the door.  Alf told my Mum to sit exactly where she was on the sofa and not to move.  The police came in asked questions, had a look round and left.  As soon as they had gone, Alf got my Mum to stand up, and then he lifted up the sofa seat and pulled out a load of jewelery.

I had hoped Alf and Eva had got married, so I searched for their marriage in the registries.  This was recently, long after Mum had died.  I ordered a marriage certificate for an Alfred Percy Purchase and Elizabeth Lichstein.  The father of the bride is listed as Jack Lichtenstein, and the rareity of that name indicates this Elizabeth Lichstein was actually Eva.

{% include image.html url="/images/1958/MAR-19581002_Alfred_Percy_Purchase_and_Elizabeth_Lichtenstein.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Marriage Certificate for Alfred Purchase and Elizabeth Lichtenstein" %}

The date of their wedding was 2nd October 1958 (18 Tishrei 5719) and it took place in Southampton.  Reading that certificate was enough to make me shed a tear as my parents were married about 5 months later, and a mere 15 miles away, on 21st February 1959 (13th Adar I 5719) in nearby Portsmouth.  I thought of my Mum wonderring what had happened to her own Mother, and her being a mere 15 miles or so away.

Having found Eva and Alfred's marriage certificate, and knowing she was using Elizabeth Purchase as her own name, I was able to search for and get a copy of her death certificate.  Eva died on 8th December 1985 (25th Kislev 5746) in Tynings Nursing Home, 32 Albert Road, Clevedon, Avon.  Nowadays this is divided into two homes.  Alfred is the informant and he was living at 15, Hastings Road, Bedminster, Bristol.  Eva's maiden name is listed as "Lichenstein".

In an earlier post, [On finding Grandma](/2019/12/01/on-finding-grandma.html), I tell how I found Eva was cremated at South Bristol Crematorium and where her ashes are scattered.

So far in my research, I have come into contact with a number of people who are willing to provide information and help me.  The first is a second cousin on my Grandfather's side who has been a tremendous help.  Recently I had a "conversation" with a fellow [Ancestry](http://ancestry.co.uk) user who had read about Eva in a family history book written by his cousin.  I am trying to get hold of a copy as it may contain information about her after she and Mum parted company.

# The end of the beginning

When I rebooted this research a couple of years ago, I thought I might be able to find a death certificate for Eva, and know where she was buried or cremated and that was it.  I never thought I would end up writing about it anywhere, or have so many questions needing to be answerredmore stories to find out about and tell.  I have two or three brutal murdershinted about some of the stories here and have several lines of research I am following, which I hope to publish in articles on here in this small site of mine.

There is a lot of murder going on in this family.  My Great Grandmother Esther, Great Aunt Kitty, and Russian Dorah are known so far.  Strictly speaking, Dorah is not part of my family, as far as I know, but there is a connection.

Once this virus starts to subside, I hope to pay a visit to Eva in South Bristol Cemetery.  I will take flowers, and my son has said he will come with me.

In the meantime, there are more letters and emails to write, more research to be done, and hopefully more posts to publish.
