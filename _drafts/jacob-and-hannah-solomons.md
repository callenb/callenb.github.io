Jacob and Hannah Solomons are my Great Great Grandparents who my Mum told me left Russia or Poland during the Pogroms in the 1880s and settled in London.  I believe Hannah came from Veisiejai in Lithuania as the birthplace entry for her in the 1901 Census is listed as Russia Vershaye.  These were written by censor takers and were often english transliterations of what the censors were told.  Vishay is the english transliteration of the Yiddish name for Veisiejai and this is the reason I am working on the assumption my Great Great Grandmother was born there in Lithuania.  I have also begun to look into the history of Jews in Lithuania and Veisiejai, to provide me with some context and help with my research.

The first Jews came to Lithuania from Germany and the surrounding countries in 1323 when Grand Duke Gediminas set out an open invitation where he set out a promise as follows:
> They may come with their children, wives and cattle, they may arrive and take leave in accordance with their wishes thus with this letter we guarantee and promise that they will be safe and immune from the unlawful claims of my subjects.
The later merger of of Poland and Lithuania along with the conversion of Lithuania to Christianity in 1386 led to these privileges being undermined.  By 1388 they were formerly reinstated under Vytautus the Greattransformation se privileges were later effectively removed by 

I am certain I also have the 1891 and 1911 Census entries and possibly the 1881 Census, though I am less certain of this.

y for this Solomons family and believe I have the 1881 Census entry too.  Their birthplace in 1881 is Poland, 1891 is Russian Poland, 1901 is Russia Vishaye and 1911 it is entered as London.  This last one is the least likely and is the first Census where the head of the family enters the information.  The picture at the top of this post is the birthplace entry for the 1901 against Hannah Solomons and I believe it is someone's attempt to spell Vishay which is the Yiddish pronunciation of Veisiejai in Lithuania.  I am working on the belief Hannah, at least, came from Veisiejai, Lithuania and have researched a little bit of information about Lithuanian Jews and Veisiejai.
