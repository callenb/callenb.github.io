## Plan

This will tell of Kitty Solomons life up to her brutal murder and the similarities of her sister.

* Birth of Kitty and education
* Age when Eva was born and possibility of looking after her when Esther was away.
* Travel to Esther in Canada and what we know of her circumstances.
* Additional journey(s)
* Marriage to Anton Moen, Buying a boat, the murder of her sister.
* Seperation from Anton.  My Mother's recollection of Kitty who she knew as aunt Bessie.
* The murder of Kitty and story intertwining newspaper reports with coroner reports 
* person who said about her rings, Norman watt. Police report a couple of years later of her and her sister.
* My Mum's story about the ring.  The contents of the will including diamond ring, Jews orphanage , red cross and Dinah's children.  Ring not found so my mum received nothing yet she always wore her diamond ring and it is on her finger in the coroner's report.
