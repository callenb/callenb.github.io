My Mother was born on 7th February 1928 (16th Sh'vat 5688) in Bethnal Green, London and about two months later on 17th April 1928 (27th Nisan 5688) her Grandmother, Esther Solomons, was brutally murdered nearly 5,000 miles away in Prince Rupert, British Colombia, Canada.

Mum never said much about her Grandmother and I suspect she never knew she had been murdered and they never had the chance to meet.

Esther's murder was a big event for a young city and [Sue Harper](http://sueharperphotography.com/) has included a section about the murder in her book, [When a Bad Wind Blows: 10 Tragic Events in the History of Prince Rupert](http://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?contributorId=216916).

If that wasn't tragic enough, almost 17 years to the day later, her sister Kitty Moen was murdered in similar circumstances on the same street.

Esther begun her life in one of the poorest streets in Whitechapel so how did she end up in the wettest city in Canada?

### Esther Solomons of Little Patternoster Row
Esther Solomons was born on 25th September 1881 (2nd Tishrei 5642), which was the 2nd day of Rosh Hashana.  Her parents were Jacob and Hannah Solomons.  Although her birth certificate has 12 Patternoster Row as the address where she was born, it was actually 12 Little Patternoster Row in Spitalfields.  I haven't found any photos of Little Patternoster Row at the time, but nearly 20 years later in 1898, Charles Booth described [Little Patternoster Row](https://booth.lse.ac.uk/notebooks/b351#?cv=55&c=0&m=0&s=0&z=730.7679%2C528.5803%2C1243.3164%2C739.5) thus:
>
> 2 & 3 storey common lodging houses. Ragged women, children, holey toeless boots; windows dirty patched with brown paper and broken. Prostitutes, thieves and ponces. Buildings owned by the notorious Jack McCarthy of Dorset Street.
>
It was coloured black on his map and designated as "vicious, semi-criminal".  The birth certificate also shows the Solomons lived at 13 Crispin Street which was a much wider and longer street running parallel to Little Patternoster Row.  The family must have known someone living in 12 Little Patternoster Row, which according to the 1881 Census from 9 months before means one of 6 families.  Little Patternoster Row no longer exists but some of Crispin Street does.  As far as I can tell, the place where number 13 was may have become part of the Spitalfields Market extension.

There is no entry for my Jacob and Hannah Solomons in the 1881 Census.  There is a Jacob and Hannah Solomons at 8 Little Patternoster Row but their ages are only one year apart instead of 7 as we will see in the 1891 Census. The 1881 Censusre reveals there are no Solomons living at 13 Crispen Street either.  My guess is they had recently arrived in London having fled from the Pogroms started around April of 1881.  If that was the case, then Hannah must have travelled whilst she was pregnant.

To gain a better understanding of my family history and lack of Jewish upbringing, I thought it would help to learn as much as I can about growing up in Jewish Whitechapel. To that end, I have read books and blog posts.  I particularly enjoyed reading Israel Zangwill's book [Children of the Ghetto A Study of a Peculiar People](https://amzn.to/319oHh1) and really warmed to Esther Ansell who is the book's heroine.  The fact she shares the same first name with my great grandmother also helped.  The book provides a good flavour of life in Jewish Whitechapel, particularly from an Orthodox perspective.  It is  abook I am sure I will read again.

Esther's father is a Tailor on her Birth certificate, but it doesn't say what Hannah did for a living.  The 1891 Census has the family living at 31 & 32 Booth Street Buildings. whereas all the children after Esther have 2 Booth Street on their Birth Certificates.  It is suffice to say they lived in Booth Street Buildings.  By 1891, Jacob is 36 and Hannah is 29 and both are Tailor Machinists born in Russian Poland.  At 9 years of age, Esther is the oldest of their 5 children and Kitty is the youngest at 1.  The other three are boys: Hyman (7), Louis (5) and Aleck (3).

### Growing Up
Although I have seen one or more school admission records for her siblings, I have yet to find any for Esther and so I do not know where she went to school.  This may be because there is no index available or it was transcribed incorrectly.  It seems a visit or two to Tower Hamlets local history archives for a search is in order.

The Census of 1901 sees the family living at 59 Nelson Street.  Jacob is no longer alive and Hannah is bringing the children up by herself.  She has all her children living with her apart from Louis.  Esther is 17 and a Tailoress as is her 40 year old mother.  Her brother Hyman is a Cabinet Maker and all the other children are at school.  The children born since the last Census are Rachael (9), Dinah (6) and Rebecca (2).

They aren't the only people living at this address.  There is a 50 year old mother and her 30 year old son who is a Traveller.  I believe this may be another name for a hawker or travelling salesman.  They come from Russia and it looks like his first name is Simon, but I can't read their surname.  There is also a 60 year old Tailor called George Day and his wife Mary from Ireland.

It is common to take in lodgers to earn a bit of extra money.

### Esther and Jack Lichtenstein
My Mum has told me Esther was married to Jack Lichtenstein and their only known child was my Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein.  I have searched high and low but so far I have never found a marriage certificate for Esther and Jack.  I have even looked for Lichstein and Jacob instead of Jack.

{% img /images/1907/BTH-19070607-Eva_lichtenstein.png 100% "Birth Certificate of Eva Lichtenstein (7-Jun-1907 to 4-Dec-1985)" title: "Birth Certificate of Eva Lichtenstein (7-Jun-1907 to 4-Dec-1985)" %}

According to Eva Lichtenstein's birth certificate, her father Jack Lichtenstein is a Hairdressers Assistant and her mother's name is entered as "Esther Lichtenstein, formerly Solomons".  This implies they were married.

Eva was born at 22 Fulbourne Street on 7th June 1907 (25th Sivan 5667).  The birth was registerred by Esther's mother, Hannah Solomons and her address was the same, which suggests they were all living together.  I knew from my mother that Eva was born in 1907 and so the birth certificate helps to tie Hannah, Esther and Eva togather with Jack.

Originally when I had almost completed this blog post, I came across a UK Outward Passenger List for an Esther Solomons leaving Liverpool on 25th September 1906 (6th Tishrei 5667) to New York.  The date would have been the same as her 25th birthday if using the Gregorian calendar.  I wasn't certain if it was my Esther, but as I scanned down the list of names, I came across a married Hairdresser with the name of "J Lichtenstein".  Esther Solomons was further down the list.  Their ages were 36 and 24 respectively.  There wasn't much on the Passenger List but one thing I did notice was their ticket numbers.  J Lichtenstein's was 49988 and Esther's was one more at 49989.

At this point I took a sharp intake of breath.  The mind invents all sorts of scenarios and questions.  The biggest being is this "J Lichtenstein" actually Jack?  Did they meet at the ticket office when buying the tickets or did they know each other beforehand?  If this man was married and Esther wasn't, what does that say?  Was this even my Esther?

I then did a search of the immigration documents in New York, which provided some more information.  The first image below has Esther clearly marked as the only passenger with an "X" next to her name.  It tells me she is a 24 year old single woman Dressmaker.  She is from England of Jewish (Hebrew) descent and her final destination is New York.  She is visiting a friend who's name looks like it is Jack Peller of 116 East 116th Street which is in East Harlem.

It also says Esther is 5 foot 2 inches, ruddy complexion with black hair and blue eyes.  My mum was under 5 foot so the height sounds like it is about right.

John is listed as being Hungarian and it could well be they 

I searched for and found Esther on the Record for Detained Aliens for this voyage as well as the New York Passenger and Crew Lists.  The entry for her tells me she is a Dressmaker visiting a friend living at 116 E 116th Street whose name I can't quite read.  The entry also says she is single, aged 24 and English Hebrew.

I turned a couple of pages further on and find a 36 year old Hairdresser called John Lichtenstein, a resident of Great Brittain who was born in Budapest as a Hungarian.  He is married and is visiting a friend called Joseph Smith who is living at 46 Pitt Street, New York.  This may or may not be my Great Grandfather Jack Lichtenstein.

### Esther and Kitty go missing for a few years
Hannah can be found in the 1911 Census living at 1 Regal Place, Old Montague Street.  This is an address my Mum has told me about as she lived there with Hannah until her death in January 1937.  The 1911 Census shows Hannah's three youngest daughters living with her.

Hannah is described as a Tailoress working at home.  Her daughter Rachel is a Tailoress as well, Dinah is a Furrier and Rebecca is at school.  The next resident is Eva Lichtenstein, her 4 year old Grand child.  I haven't been able to find Esther or Jack on any Census record and it seems they have vanished, leaving Eva in the hands of her mother.

I suspect they are abroad somewhere, but passenger list searches haven't turned up a Jacob and Esther Lichtenstein or variant that could be them.  The most recent dated record I have of them is where Jack Lichtenstein is listed as deceased on the marriage certificate of my Grandparents.  Jack was a Hairdresser, which is what my Grandfather was too.

### Was Aunt Bessy actually my Grandmother?
My Mum and Grandmother fell out over a ring Aunt Bessy had supposedly left my Mum in her will.  My Mum never received the ring, but my Grandmother didn't believe her and they fell out over it.  My Mum had said Aunt Bessy came over from Canada and treated her Mother as if she was one of her own.

It was at this point I had a wild idea that Aunt Bessy was actually my Great Grandmother.  To that end I started searching for Solomons travelling to Canada.

### Esther's journey's between Canada and England
My search now concentrated on Esther where I found records of Esther travelling backwards and forwards between England and Canada.  My Mother never knew her Grandmother so I had assumed she had died before she was old enough to remember her.

There is a lot of interesting information on the passenger lists and other documents, which I will come back to.  In the mean time here is the list of sailing records I have for Esther.  The first one in 1906 was the last one I found.

* Esther Solomons departed Liverpool on 25th September 1906 bound for New York.
* Esther Killas arrived in Liverpool, England from Quebec, Canada on 4th July 1921.
* Esther Killas arrived in Quebec, Canada from Ecuador on 29th August 1921.  I'm assuming this is her return trip for the previous sailing.
* Esther Killas arrived in Quebec, Canada from Southampton, England having left there on 29th September 1921.
* Esther Killas left Southampton, England on 17th July 1925, arriving in Quebec, Canada on 26th July 1925.
* Esther Killas left Southampton, England on 22nd April 1927, arriving in Quebec, Canada on 30th April 1927.
* 29th April 1927, Kitty Moen departed Liverpool and arrived in Quebec Canada on 5th May 1927.

Esther Lichtenstein is the name of the witness on Eva's marriage certificate so she must have had a trip in 1926 as well.  Assuming that is the case, it means she visited England in 1925, 1926 and 1927.

The first travel record in the list is the last one I came across.  There is an Esther Solomons 5th from the bottom of it.  She is a 24 year old Dressmaker which up until just before I wrote this was only a possibility.  I just scanned down the list and I came across a 36 year old Hairdresser by the name of J. Lichtenstein.  Naturally I thought could this be my Great Grandfather?  I wanted to hope so because meeting on a voyage across the ocean is pretty romantic.  Then I noticed something which surely can't be a coincidence.  J Lichtenstein's ticket number is 49988 and if you add one to it you end up with 49989, which is the ticket number belonging to Esther Solomons.
