## Plan
This post is about my Great Grandmother Esther Solomons who left England for New York in September 1906, returned to give birth to my Grandmother in June 1907 and set off to New York without her in September 1907.  She lived her whole life abroad, firstly in New York and then moved to Prince Rupert in 1913.  She was murdered in April 1928.

* First child of Jacob and Hannah Solomons born 25 Sep 1881 in Little Patternoster Row - one of the worst streets in london according to Booth
* Family living in Crispen Street at the time and speculation as to why she was born in Little Patternoster Row - see 1881 census.
* No school, probably left school at age x in year y
* Occupation in 1901 was a Dressmaker and this is what many documents say except when she appears to have had no job.
* Detail passenger list in September 1906 connection with John Lichtenstein as name occupation of Hairdresser, ticket number, and marriage status.  
* "Biography" of John Lichtenstein and speculation with respect to wife (Fanny?)
* Who Esther was visiting (family or friend?) Where they may have lived - New York or Brooklyn.  How long she may have stayed - not just a couple of weeks, more like months.
* Unknown return to England, birth of Eva and departure so by 1911 4 year old Eva was with Hannah but Esther was nowhere.
* 1913 arrival in Prince Rupert
* marriage to Killas. 
* Visit of Kitty and her marriage to Anton Moen
* Known and speculated returns to England and stay at Hannah's.
* Presence at daughter's marriage and name and occupation of Eva's father on her marriage certificate.  Mention Eva's second marriage and occupation on that too.
* Birth of my Mother followed by murder of Esther.
* Description from Newspapers of police enquiries.  Describe what the "Restricted Area" wa.  Intersperse investigation with info from Coroner's report.  Also mention Kitty's involvement.
* Laid to rest in cemetery give plot and headstone.  "Gone but not forgotten" relate to Plashet book of cemetery where her dad is at rest.  Does this phrase mean anything for Jews? Is it a standdard phrase.
* Esther's will, what she owned (Shares, Boat, money and current equivalent) and boat Anton and Kitty recently acquired.  All went to Eva and how much she got in today's money?  X years later she had seperated from Marks and had most likely blown the money except possibly that left for her daughter who was living with Hannah at roughly the same age as Eva had done x years before.
* End with book with chapter about this, Sue Harper being touched by the story and that other guy and the potential (non) murderer
