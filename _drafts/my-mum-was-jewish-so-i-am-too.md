Jacqueline Chemerofsky was my Jewish Mum, but I didn't know she was Jewish until I was about 9 or 10.  It came out one day when my Dad and I were on our way to his Allotment in Oxbridge Avenue.  At the time we were living at 77 Hind Street, Stockton-on-Tees, in a house his father left to him.  The Allotment was about a mile away from our home, which was 5 doors down from the Trades & Labour club. 

My dad had spent much of his childhood about half-way down the street at number 48.  It had a brass doorstop which his Mother polished until it shone.  Its other claim to fame was it sometimes had a Brough Superior motorcycle parked outside when my Uncle Allan use to race for a living.  The motorcycle is a real collectors piece now.  In it's day before World War II, it was the Rolls-Royce of motorcycles.  Each one was built twice and depending on which model it was, they were ridden at either 80 or 100 mph.  It would have been unusual to see one sitting outside a terraced house in Stockton-on-Tees and needless to say was an attraction to the local children.  Unfortunately, my uncle ended up with a couple of metal plates in his head.

I can't remember what led up to my Dad revealing my Mum was Jewish, but I remember we had just reached the Cemetery on Oxbridge Lane.  There are a couple of headstones about 10 yards along the road from where the cemetery begins.  The name on them is my "Callender" name.  My Dad didn't know who they were.

As we reached them my dad was saying "your Mum is scared of her own shadow, we need to look out for her.  She's Jewish and we only found out her real surname when we went to Australia. She wouldn't want you to tell anyone because she is worried what might happen if people found out."  

My head was full of questions, most of which had some kind of an answer by the time we got to the end of the cemetery and could see the Allotments.  Why was she worried people might find out she was Jewish?  Am I Jewish? Is my dad Jewish?  Why didn't she know her own surname?  What did she think her surname was?  What is her real surname?  And of course what exactly is being Jewish?  It is this last question I am only just beginning to understand over 46 years later.

My Mum was born on 7th February 1928 at 3 Clarkson Street, Bethnal Green, London.  Her father was a Journeyman Hairdresser called Mark Chemerofsky and her mother was Eva Lichtenstein who was a Milliner.   They were married on 10th June 1926 in a Registry Office.  My Mum said there was a diamond in the back of each of Eva's shoes on her wedding day.  Mark was 22 and Eva was 19 when they were married.

That evening the local newspaper had a story on the front page about the arrest of Mark's brother.  He'd escaped from Pentonville prison the previous October and had been apprehended after a fight.  Heid already been calling himself Sidney Morris rather than the name he was born with.

Soon after my Mum was born they moved to a dairy in 56 Vallance Road, also in Bethnal Green. By the time my Mum was 3 years old, Mark and Eva had parted company and the dairy had turned into a Milliners owned by Eva Morris who is really Eva Lichtenstein..

My Mum has often said both Mark and Eva lead a colourful life.  Mark apparently liked a drink and to gamble as well.  She frequently told me how Mark once broke into 56 Vallance Road and took her from her bedroom.  She also said the dairy became a Milliners.  I have looked in the London Street directories where it shows 56 Vallance road as being a dairy and then turning into a Milliners in 19
