Jacob and Hannah Solomons are my Great Great Grandparents found by tracing up through my Mum's female line.  My Mum believed they had left Russia or Poland during the Pogroms in the 1880s and made their way to London, where my Mum was eventually born.  Hannah was very special to Mum, but she was never sure which country she came from, let alone the city, town or village.  This is something I hope I am close to finding out, and one day I may even come to know beyond any reasonable doubt.

## Where and when do I think they were born?

As yet I have seen nothing to tell me where Jacob was born beyond "Russia", which could equate to many countries in existence today.The evidence points to him being born in 1855.

I had originally thought Hannah came from somewhere called [Pershay](https://www.jewishgen.org/belarus/lists/Economic/PERSHSUM.html) near Minsk in Belarus, but that changed near the end of 2020.  I had started transferring all my genealogy files and information into [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/blog/).  I was reading each document to record every piece of information on them, and that's how I came to reject Pershay in favour of [Veisiejai](https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/vishey/vishey1.html) in Lithuania.

The image at the top of this post is of Hannah's birthplace on the 1901 UK Census.  I'd seen it written as Pershaye in other people's family trees and had just copied what they had written.  When I looked at the Census with fresh eyes and an open mind, I could see the first letter is clearly a "V" and not a "P".  The 1901 Census is the last one to be filled in by Census agents and not the head of the household as it has been since 1911.  This means it is important to listen to the sound of unfamiliar places, as much if not more, than how they are spelt.  It also means there are plenty of examples of the writer's handwriting to help decipher how they write their letters.

In this case just 8 lines further down there was an entry for "Villias" and 9 lines above is an entry for Poland.  Even looking at the entry in the image above, and without other references, it is so obviously a "V".  The Census person would have written what they heard Hannah say, and "Vishay" is how the Yiddish name for Veisiejai is pronounced.  For this reason, I am now working on the theory that Hannah, at least, was born in Veisiejai in Lithuania during 1862.

## Lithuania and the arrival of the jews

Veisiejai is in present day Lithuania and about 195 km due west of Pershai.  The two places are almost on the same parallel.  There is a map in [The Seven Kingdoms of the Litvaks](https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/Lithuania/7_KingdomsLitvaks.pdf) by [Dovid Katz](https://www.dovidkatz.net/) that shows the dialect and cultural borders of Lithuania and it includes both Veisiejai and Pershai.  My Great Grandfather through my Mum's male line came from Bialystok in present day Poland.  This is also part of cultural Lithuania.  The national borders and names of places change over time, so it is useful to find out where a place was at the time your ancestors lived there.  I was also interested to know how long Jews had lived in Lithuania, and Vishay in particular.

The [Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) taking place in medieval europe between 1097 and 1271 and other persecutions drove the Ashkenazic Jews towards the east.  The tolerant, multiculturist kings of Poland and Lithuania provided an environment where the Ashkenazic Jews were able to come back together.  [Boleslav the Pious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_the_Pious) granted the [Statute of Kalisz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Kalisz) which became the best known Polish charter of privileges for Jewish subjects in 1264.  This was extended to all of Poland by [Casimir the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great) in 1334.

There is a traditions about a charter being issued in Lithuania by Grand Duke Gediminas that is likely to be folklore relating to the years he founded Vilna (Vilnius) in the early 1320s.  Vytautas issued Jewish charters for Brisk (Brest) and Troki (Trakai) in 1388, for which the texts are still preserved today.  These closely followed the Polish model, but a year later, in 1389, he issued a charter for the Jews of Grodna (Hrodna, Belarus) which broke bold new ground.  Dovid Katz describes it as:

> a remarkable document of East European tolerance in the age of western intolerance, and a stunning testament to the achievement of Lithuanianness in the "Grand Duchy sense" of a confederation of peoples, cultures and religeons (not to be confused with the much later ethnocentric sense that rose in the spirit of modern nationalism)

The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was formed in 1569, reaching it's Golden Age in the early 17th century. By the middle of that century it was declining and most of Lithuania was occupied by Swedish or Russian armies. Eventually the Commonwealth was partitioned by the Russian Empire, Prussia and the Habsburg Monachy in 1772, 1792 and 1795.  The largest area of Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire and the rest ended up in Prussia.

## The arrival of Jews in Vishay

Joseph Rosin tells us on his ["Vishey (Veisiejai)"](https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/vishey/vishey1.html) pages that it was founded during the first half of the sixteenth century and ended up as part of Prussia following the partition in 1795 until Napoleon defeated Prussia in 1807. Vishay then became part of "The Great Dukedom of Warsaw", and the Napoleonic codex became the constitution according to which everybody was equal before the law, except for the Jews who were not granted any civil rights.  The defeat of Napoleon in 1815 meant all of Lithuania was annexed to Russia.

It appears that in the middle of the eighteenth century, Jews started to settle in Vishay following an invite.  A document from 1783 states there were several tens of Jewish families living in Vishay where they had a synagogue and a ["Kahal"](https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Kahal).  There were 518 people and 85 houses in Vishay. By 1827 the number of people had grown to 737, and by 1897 the population of Vishay numbered 1,540 people including 974 Jews.

However by that date, Jacob and Hannah had been living in London and all their children had been born.

## Coming to London

The economic situation for Jews in Vishay was sound until a big fire in 1872 badly affected the economy for many years to come.  It was during this period that many Jews began to leave Vishay.  The men often left first to find work, and then the women and children would follow later.  These were arduous and often dangerous journeys across hostile lands.

I can't be certain when Jacob and Hannah arrived in London but I do know their first child was born in September 1881.  With that in mind, I have found an interesting candidate for a potential marriage date.

This marriage between Jacob Solomons and Annie Levison took place in The [Princes Street Synagogue](https://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/London/EE_princelet/index.htm) on 29th December 1880 (27th Tevet 5641).  At 22 years old, the groom is three years younger than other records show my Jacob Solomons to have been, but his occupation of a Tailor is the same.  Though there were many in that position at the time.

The bride is the right age for Hannah, but Annie isn't her name.  However Annie could have been the result of a british person not hearing Hannah properly, and according to Wikipedia, [Anne, Ann, and other forms of the name derive from the Hellenized Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_(name)).  Not a great leap from Hannah to Annie.

The participants in this marriage certificate were living at 6 Sandy's Row, which does not make an appearance on the Census of 1881, suggesting the place had become empty.  I have been unable to trace any Jacob and Annie Solomons with a marriage around this time.  The closest was a Jacob and Fanny Solomons, but they hadn't arrived in the UK until several years after this date.

The 1881 Census includes a Jacob and Hannah Solomons living at 8 Little Patternoster Row, and their ages match this marriage certificate.  This is interesting because Jacob and Hannah's first child was born on 25th September 1881 (2nd Tishrei 5642) in 12 Little Patternoster Row, whilst their own address was at 13 Crispen Street, which runs behind Little Patternoster Row.  I suspect Hannah gave birth in the home of someone she knew from when living at number 8.

If the marriage certificate is my Great Great Grandparents, then it took place almost exactly 9 months before their first child was born.  Although not 100% convincing, it is a reasonable candidate.

{% include image.html url="/images/1881/BTH-18810925-Solomons_Esther.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Birth Certificate of Esther Solomons (25-Sep-1881 to 17-Apr-1928)" %}

Their first child is my Great Grandmother, Esther Solomons.  She became a Dressmaker, went to New York in 1906, gave birth to my Grandmother in 1907, and returned to New York without her.  Esther returned to England to stay with Hannah, but never took my Grandmother back with her.  My Mum didn't know Esther because she was murdered in Prince Rupert, Canada when my Mum was about two months old.  My Mum knew Esther had died, but didn't know the gruesome circumstances.

Despite what her birth certificate says, I am certain Esther was born in 12 Little Patternoster Row, and not "Patternoster Row", which is behind St Pauls Cathedral in London.  Jacob is a Tailor and Hannah's maiden name is recorded as Levinson, as it is on all the birth certificates of their children.  There are Levinson's known to have been living in Vishay at the start of World War II, which is a tenuous link between Hannah and Vishay.

One of them was [Joseph Levinson](http://josephlevinson.com/).  A remarkable man who went on to ensure memorials were erected in Lithuania at all the places where the Nazis had murdered Jews.  He recorded these in [The Book of Sorrows](http://josephlevinson.com/summary/).  He also pulled together a book called [The Shoah in Lithuania](http://josephlevinson.com/summary-2/) the purpose of which is to:
> provide a broader audience of readers with the opportunity to become acquainted with what really happened during the Shoah in Lithuania and to grasp its terrible consequences, scale, and the role of individual factors in it.

Joseph was born in 1917 and died in Vilnius, Lithuania on 9th April 2015.

## Building a family in London

If the earlier information is correct then the Solomons moved around quite a bit with three different addresses in 9 months.  This wasn't uncommon when immigrants were trying to establish themselves and get steady work.

After Esther was born, they seem to have settled down as their next four children were all born in 2 New Buildings, Booth Street, which was a continuation of Princes Street at the time, and was later joined with it, eventually becoming Princelet Street.  

Their second child was a boy named Hyman who was born on 13th June 1883 (8th Sivan 5643). He became a Cabinet Maker.  Next came Louis on 28th january 1886 (22nd Sh'vat 5646) who began working as a Porter and later became a Fruit Merchant.  I believe he had a shop in Forest Gate and my Mum use to visit them quite regularly.  Their fourth child, and last son was Alexander and he was born on 6th December 1887 (20thh Kislev 5648).  He was a Commercial Traveller and was probably married in 1907. He was killed in France during World War I, and is commemorated at the [Arras Memorial](https://www.cwgc.org/visit-us/find-cemeteries-memorials/cemetery-details/82700/arras-memorial/).

The last child born in Booth Street was Kitty on 24th December 1889 (1st Tevet 5650).  I have nothing which tells me what occupation Kitty took up.  She moved to Canada to live near Esther and was married there in 1926.  My Mum knew Kitty and told me she disturbed some burglars and was murdered in 1945.  The truth is there were no burglars and she was actually murdered almost exactly 17 years to teh day after her sister Esther.  It was in the same street and under similar circumstances.
