Before today there were 6 posts on this blog about my Jewish family history, which has turned out to be more than I bargained for.  They were all written between 31-Jul-2019 and 1-Dec-2019.  Now there are three including this one.  I have been reading them over and over again and have decided all but ["Where's Grandma"](/2019/07/31/wheres-grandma.html) and ["Armistice Day"](/2019/11/11/armistice-day.html) needed to be taken down so I could mostly start again.

I'm uncovering information fairly regulary, even through the Covid-19 pandemic, and I just feel alot of what I had posted was incomplete snippets of one unfinished story.  Although it isn't possible to tell truly complete family history stories, I should at the very least tell everything I know.  I should also wait until I know enough to tell a story.

## Anything interesting here?

My Mother was Jewish and my Father was not.  I have concentrated on my Jewish Grandmother's side of my family because this all started when my Mum said she wanted to know what happened to her Mum.  They fell out around 1949/50 and never saw each other again.  Earlier, when I said my family history has turned out to bemore than I bargained for, let me just spend a little time outlining some of what I know, and so what may be included in future posts.

My 2nd Great Grandparents on my Grandmother's side were Jacob Solomons and Hannah (Levinson) Solomons and were likely born in Vishay, Lithuania in 1855 and 1862 respectively.  They arrived in England before September 1881 when the first of their eight children were born.

Her name was Esther Solomons and she is my Great Grandmother.  She went to New York in September 1906, seems to have met a married man on board, and nine months later, gave birth to my Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein.  Then in September 1907, she returned to New York without Eva, who was left with her Hannah.  Esther ended up in Prince Rupert, Canada in 1913, married a greek Candy Maker cum Cook and was brutally murdered in 1928.  It was front page news for days and remains unsolved.

Eva got married in 1926, gave birth to my Mum in 1928, was seperated from my Grandfather in 1931 and ended up marrying a Cat Burglar from Bristol who once robbed Lord Beaverbrook.

Jacob and Hannah's next three children were all boys.  Hyman was a Cabinet Maker, Louis worked as a Fruit Merchant and Alexander was a Commercial Traveller who lost his life in France during WWI.

Next came four girls.  The first was Kitty who followed Esther to Canada, where she got married and was later murdered in the same street as Esther was murdered almost exactly 17 years to the day before her.  She left my Mum a one and one-half carat single diamond ring in her will.  It was an argument over the whereabouts of this ring which lead to my Mum and Grandmother falling out.

The last three girls were Rachael, Dinah and Rebecca.

My Mother lived in 126 Long Acre, London, with a lady she called an Aunt, who Mum says witnessed a murder that I have found was of [Russian Dora](http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=1275&termRef=Dora%20Freedman).  Though probably not my family, I have been keeping an eye on Ellen, which I believe is her name rather than Helen.  The Electoral Register shows my Mum lived there two years after the Murder.

Reading the coroner reports about the murder of my Great Grandmother and her sister was quite harrowing to say the least.  My Mum never knew her Grandmother had been murdered.  Having set out on a Journey to find what happened to my Grandmother, I wasn't expecting it either.

## Is that it then?

There are further stories on my Jewish Grandfather's side, and goodness knows what my Dad's side will bring up.

All this murder wasn't the most upsetting thing I have discovered.  My parents were married in Portsmouth during February 1959.  My Grandmother, who my Mum last saw in London about twenty years before, had married her Cat Burglar four months before, down the road in Southampton.  My Mum was so desperate to find her Mum, and it turned out they had lived about 15 miles apart for a number of years and she never knew.  It is very possible they could havebeen in the same shop at the same time, or walking down the same street.  So close and yet so far.

So that is a quick roundup of some of what I know.  If there are still just three posts on this site when you are reading this, please be assured I have already written at least threeothers to be published shortly.

See you soon.
