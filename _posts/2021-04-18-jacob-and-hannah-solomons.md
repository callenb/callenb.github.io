Jacob and Hannah Solomons are my Great Great Grandparents found by tracing up through my Mum's female line.  My Mum believed they had left Russia or Poland during the Pogroms in the 1880s and made their way to London, where my Mum was eventually born.  Hannah was very special to Mum, but she was never sure which country she came from, let alone the city, town or village.  This is something I hope I am close to finding out, and one day I hope to come to know beyond any reasonable doubt.

## Where and when do I think they were born?

As yet I have seen nothing to tell me where Jacob was born beyond "Russia", which could equate to many countries in existence today.The evidence points to him being born between 1855 and 1858.

I had originally thought Hannah came from somewhere called [Pershay](https://www.jewishgen.org/belarus/lists/Economic/PERSHSUM.html) near Minsk in Belarus, but that changed near the end of 2020.  I had started transferring all my genealogy files and information into [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/blog/).  I was reading each document to record every piece of information on them, and that's how I came to reject Pershay in favour of [Veisiejai](https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/vishey/vishey1.html) in Lithuania.

The image at the top of this post is of Hannah's birthplace on the 1901 UK Census.  I'd seen it written as Pershaye in other people's family trees and had just copied what they had written.  When I looked at the Census with fresh eyes and an open mind, I could see the first letter is clearly a "V" and not a "P".  The 1901 Census is the last one to be filled in by Census agents and not the head of the household as it has been since 1911.  This means it is important to listen to the sound of unfamiliar places, as much if not more, than how they are spelled.  It also means there are plenty of examples of the writer's handwriting to help decipher how they write their letters.

In this case just 8 lines further down there was an entry for "Villias" and 9 lines above is an entry for Poland.  Even looking at the entry in the image above, and without other references, it is so obviously a "V".  The Census person would have written what they heard Hannah say, and "Veshay" is how the Yiddish name for Veisiejai is pronounced, though i have usually seem it transliterated as "Vishay".  For this reason, I am now working on the theory that Hannah, at least, was born in Veisiejai in Lithuania during 1862.

## Lithuania and the arrival of the jews

Veisiejai is in present day Lithuania and about 195 km due west of Pershai.  The two places are almost on the same parallel.  There is a map in [The Seven Kingdoms of the Litvaks](https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/Lithuania/7_KingdomsLitvaks.pdf) by [Dovid Katz](https://www.dovidkatz.net/) that shows the dialect and cultural borders of Lithuania and it includes both Veisiejai and Pershai.  My Great Grandfather through my Mum's male line came from Bialystok in present day Poland.  This is also part of cultural Lithuania.  The national borders and names of places change over time, so it is useful to find out where a place was at the time your ancestors lived there.  I was also interested to know how long Jews had lived in Lithuania, and Vishay in particular.

The [Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) taking place in medieval europe between 1097 and 1271 and other persecutions drove the Ashkenazic Jews towards the east.  The tolerant, multiculturist kings of Poland and Lithuania provided an environment where the Ashkenazic Jews were able to come back together.  [Boleslav the Pious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_the_Pious) granted the [Statute of Kalisz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Kalisz) which became the best known Polish charter of privileges for Jewish subjects in 1264.  This was extended to all of Poland by [Casimir the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great) in 1334.

There is a tradition about a charter being issued in Lithuania by Grand Duke Gediminas that is likely to be folklore relating to the years he founded Vilna (Vilnius) in the early 1320s.  Vytautas issued Jewish charters for Brisk (Brest) and Troki (Trakai) in 1388, for which the texts are still preserved today.  These closely followed the Polish model, but a year later, in 1389, he issued a charter for the Jews of Grodna (Hrodna, Belarus) which broke bold new ground.  Dovid Katz describes it as:

> a remarkable document of East European tolerance in the age of western intolerance, and a stunning testament to the achievement of Lithuanianness in the "Grand Duchy sense" of a confederation of peoples, cultures and religeons (not to be confused with the much later ethnocentric sense that rose in the spirit of modern nationalism)

The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was formed in 1569, reaching it's Golden Age in the early 17th century. By the middle of that century it was declining and most of Lithuania was occupied by Swedish or Russian armies. Eventually the Commonwealth was partitioned by the Russian Empire, Prussia and the Habsburg Monachy in 1772, 1792 and 1795.  The largest area of Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire and the rest ended up in Prussia.

## The arrival of Jews in Vishay

Joseph Rosin tells us on his ["Vishey (Veisiejai)"](https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/vishey/vishey1.html) pages that it was founded during the first half of the sixteenth century and ended up as part of Prussia following the partition in 1795 until Napoleon defeated Prussia in 1807. Vishay then became part of "The Great Dukedom of Warsaw", and the Napoleonic codex became the constitution according to which everybody was equal before the law, except for the Jews who were not granted any civil rights.  The defeat of Napoleon in 1815 meant all of Lithuania was annexed to Russia.

It appears that in the middle of the eighteenth century, Jews started to settle in Vishay following an invite.  A document from 1783 states there were several tens of Jewish families living in Vishay where they had a synagogue and a ["Kahal"](https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Kahal).  There were 518 people and 85 houses in Vishay. By 1827 the number of people had grown to 737, and by 1897 the population of Vishay numbered 1,540 people including 974 Jews.

However by that date, Jacob and Hannah had been living in London and all their children had been born.

## Coming to London

The economic situation for Jews in Vishay was sound until a big fire in 1872 badly affected the economy for many years to come.  It was during this period that many Jews began to leave Vishay.  The men often left first to find work, and then the women and children would follow later.  These were arduous and often dangerous journeys across hostile lands.  Some travellers still managed to visti friends and family on the way.

I can't be certain when Jacob and Hannah arrived in London but I do know their first child was born in September 1881.  With that in mind, I have found an interesting candidate for a potential marriage date.

{% include image.html url="/images/1880/MAR-18801229_jacob_solomons_and_annie_levison.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Marriage Certificate of Jacob Solomons & Annie Levison (29-Dec-1880)" %}

This marriage between Jacob Solomons and Annie Levison took place in The [Princes Street Synagogue](https://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/London/EE_princelet/index.htm) on 29th December 1880 (27th Tevet 5641).  At 22 years old, the groom is three years younger than other records show my Jacob Solomons to have been, but his occupation of a Tailor is the same.  Though there were many in that position at the time.

The bride is the right age for Hannah, but Annie isn't her name.  However Annie could have been the result of a british person not hearing Hannah properly, and according to Wikipedia, [Anne, Ann, and other forms of the name derive from the Hellenized Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_(name)).  Not a great leap from Hannah to Annie.

The participants in this marriage certificate were living at 6 Sandy's Row, which doesn't make an appearance on the Census of 1881, suggesting the place had become empty.  The address happens to be opposite [Sandy's Row Synaogue](https://sandysrowsynagogue.org/), which is a Dutch Jewish synagogue, and not Ashkenazi Jewish as Jacob and Hannah were, hence being married farther away. I have been unable to trace any other Jacob and Annie Solomons, or even similar, with a marriage around this time.  The closest was a Jacob and Fanny Solomons, but they hadn't arrived in the UK until several years after this date.

The 1881 Census includes a Jacob and Hannah Solomons living at 8 Little Patternoster Row, and their ages match this marriage certificate.  This is interesting because Jacob and Hannah's first child was born on 25th September 1881 (2nd Tishrei 5642) in 12 Little Patternoster Row, whilst their own address was at 13 Crispen Street, which ran behind Little Patternoster Row.  I suspect Hannah gave birth in the home of someone she knew from when living at number 8, or they moved soon after the birth which was registered about 30 days later.

If the marriage certificate is my Great Great Grandparents, then it took place almost exactly 9 months before their first child was born.  Several factors lead to this being a reasonable candidate for their marriage certificate.  The maiden name and age of the bride is correct; the name and occupation of the groom is also correct;  there is enough time before the birth of their first child; and no other Jacob and Hannah (or Annie) has been found (so far) in later records.

## Making a family in London

{% include image.html url="/images/1881/BTH-18810925-Solomons_Esther.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Birth Certificate of Esther Solomons (25-Sep-1881 to 17-Apr-1928)" %}

Their first child was my Great Grandmother, Esther Solomons.  She became a Dressmaker, went to New York in 1906, gave birth to my Grandmother in 1907, and returned to New York without her.  Esther returned to England many times and stayed with Hannah, but never took my Grandmother back abroad with her.  My Mum didn't know Esther because she was murdered in Prince Rupert, Canada when my Mum was about two months old.  She knew Esther had died, but didn't know the gruesome circumstances.

Despite what her birth certificate says, I am certain Esther was born in 12 Little Patternoster Row, and not "Patternoster Row", which is behind St Pauls Cathedral in London.  Jacob is a Tailor and Hannah's maiden name is recorded as Levinson, as it is on all the birth certificates of their children.  There are Levinson's known to have been living in Vishay at the start of World War II, which is another, albeit tenuous, link between Hannah and Vishay.

One of them was [Joseph Levinson](http://josephlevinson.com/).  A remarkable man who went on to ensure memorials were erected in Lithuania at all the places where the Nazis had murdered Jews.  He recorded these in [The Book of Sorrows](http://josephlevinson.com/summary/).  He also pulled together a book called [The Shoah in Lithuania](http://josephlevinson.com/summary-2/) the purpose of which is to:
> provide a broader audience of readers with the opportunity to become acquainted with what really happened during the Shoah in Lithuania and to grasp its terrible consequences, scale, and the role of individual factors in it.

Joseph was born in 1917 and died in Vilnius, Lithuania on 9th April 2015.

If the earlier information is correct then the Solomons moved around quite a bit with three different addresses in the first 9 months of their marriage.  This wasn't uncommon when immigrants were trying to establish themselves and get steady work.  It was also a normal way of life for many a poor person who struggled until the day they died.

After Esther was born, they seem to have settled down for a while as their next five children were all born in 2 New Buildings, Booth Street, which was a continuation of Princes Street at the time, and was later joined with it, eventually becoming Princelet Street.

[British History Online](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol27/pp265-288#h3-0034) describes their home as:

> These tenement dwellings exemplified speculative building of the later nineteenth century at its worst. They appear to have been built about 1878 on a site leased from the Halifax-Osborn estate. They consisted of three four-storeyed blocks at right angles to Princelet Street, built in the cheapest manner possible of stock brick with stone lintels. Wooden staircases served four rooms and a service wing on each floor, and although some rooms were intercommunicating they were apparently let singly from the first. The ground storey fronting the street contained shops. The builder's name is unknown. The buildings were demolished in 1955–6.

It seems they may have had two rooms rather than one, although I don't know if that was from when they first moved in or some time afterwards.

Their second child was a boy named Hyman who was born on 13th June 1883 (8th Sivan 5643). He became a Cabinet Maker.  Next came Louis on 28th January 1886 (22nd Sh'vat 5646) who began working as a Porter and later became a Fruit Merchant.  His names was spelled Lewsi on his Birth Certificate but all other documents have it as Louis, and one of his Grandsons told me.  Their fourth child, and last son was Alexander, and he was born on 6th December 1887 (20th Kislev 5648).  He was a Commercial Traveller who was killed in France during World War I, and is commemorated at the [Arras Memorial](https://www.cwgc.org/visit-us/find-cemeteries-memorials/cemetery-details/82700/arras-memorial/).

I've been looking into the possibility that Louis and Alexander may have ended up in prison for stealing along with a man called Henry Solomons.  If this checks out then Henry could be a cousin of the family.

Their second daughter, Kitty, was born on 24th December 1889 (1st Tevet 5650).  I have nothing which tells me what occupation Kitty took up.  She moved to Canada to live near Esther and was married there in 1926.  My Mum knew Kitty and told me she disturbed some burglars and was murdered in 1945.  The truth is there were no burglars, but she was murdered almost exactly 17 years to the day after her sister Esther.  It was in the same street and under similar circumstances.

{% include image.html url="/images/1891/CENSUS-1891-Solomons_Jacob-31_32_Booth_Street.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Census of 1891 at 31 & 32 Booth Street Buildings" %}

The Census of 1891 shows their address as 31 & 32 Booth Street Buildings which is also listed as 2 rooms on the Census.  Hannah's name is written as Annie, Jacob is 36 years old and she is 29.  This suggests he was born in 1855.  Both Jacob and Annie are Tailor Machinists and they are employed by someone else.

Despite what the Census says, this is the same address as the 2 Booth Street written on the birth certificates.  Their third daughter, Rachel, who became a Tailoress,  was born later that year on 25th December 1891 (24 Kislev 5652), and once again the address on her birth certificate is 2 Booth Street.  The difference in the address name must be down to the official Census name and what it was commonly referred as.

Their last two children were born at different addresses.  Dinah was born on 23rd July 1894 (19th Tamuz 5654) when the family were living at 24 Heneage Street.  She became a Fur Coat Finisher & Liner.  Rebecca was born at 22 Thomas Street on 29th April 1897 (27th Nisan 5657), and she was a Fur Liner according to her marriage certificate.  

## Early years education

The [1870 Education Act](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/livinglearning/school/overview/1870educationact/) set about the task of providing education on a national scale, but did not make it compulsory.  In 1880 another education act made school compulsory for children aged between 5 and 10.  This was extended to 11 in 1893, and 12 in 1899.

Poorer families needed their children to work, and even with compulsory education, the rate of truancy was high as families struggled to survive without their children working too.  Many of those who did attend school would go to work outside of school hours.

Due to the laws on compulsory education, it is entirely possible for Esther to have finished school at 10, Hyman and Louis at 11 and the rest of the children at 12.

Hyman, Alex, Kitty and Rachel were all registerd at Chicksand Street School by Jacob.  I have not found any records for Esther or Louis, but it is likely they were also registered at the same school.

The School Admission records include the date the child was being admitted and the address of the person bringing them to registration. For Hyman on 11th February 1889 and both Alex and Kitty on 14th February 1893 it was 2 Booth Street.  When it came to Rachel on 4th May 1895 the address was 24 Heneage Street.

School became compulsory from 1880, but it wasn't free.  Not only were families having to find the money to pay for school, they were also likely to lose income from their children's labour. It must have been very hard for many and even by the 1890s the rate of school attendence was just 82%.

Even with both Jacob and Hannah working as Tailor Machinists and the older children no longer required to go to school, it must have been hard to shelter and feed a family of eight children.

## Jacob contracts consumption

By the time Rebecca was born in 1897, Jacob had been taken ill with Consumption, which was described as a form of Tuberculosis in the [January 1897 edition of the american Popular Science Monthly](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_50/January_1897/Consumption_and_Consumptives).  It is a contagious disease but this was not understood until around the time he contracted it.  The disease particularly affected poor people who lived in the cramped conditions of places like the East End of London.  Nowadays, we can get a vacination to protect us from Tuberculosis, but it wasn't until 1921 when trials of it (BCG) had begun.  It took another 7 years before the League of Nations approved BCG as a vaccination against Tuberculosis.

Many people suffered from Consumption, and Jacob was one of them.  Just 14 months after Rebecca was born, Jacob succombed to the disease and died on 5th June 1898 (15th Sivan 5658).  The cause of death was entered as "Consumption of the lungs (Tuberculosis) (2 years)".  This means he had been carrying the disease for 2 years, and was probably working as much as he could during that time.

{% include image.html url="/images/1898/DTH-18980603-Dolomons_Jacob.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Death Certificate of Jacob Solomons (1855-5 June 1898" %}

Jacob is buried in [Plashet Jewish Cemetery](https://www.theus.org.uk/article/plashet-cemetery) in plot A-13-38, which had opened the year before.  It is no longer open, and can only be visited by appointment with United Synagogue.  I suspect there isn't much left of Jacob's headstone, but once Covid allows it, I will hopefully arrange a visit to see for myself, and leave a stone.

Now Hannah had to bring the family up as best she could.  The ages of Esther, Hyman and Louis meant they didn't have to go to school and could work instead.  It is quite possible for Esther to have left school by 1893, Hyman by 1895, and Louis would leave school in the year Jacob died.  The three children would not have been able to make as much money as the experienced Tailor Machinist that Jacob was, but it would have been better than nothing.

Rebecca was 14 Months old and Dinah was under school age so life was not going to be easy balancing work and child care.  I expect the older children would have shared the burden of bringing the family up.

Hannah took Dinah to be registered at the new [Smith Street School](https://www.stepneypark.towerhamlets.sch.uk/page/?title=Our+History+%2F+Amalgamation&pid=9) (Stepney Park Primary since July 2020) on 11th June 1900.  The family had moved to 21 Block A, Stepney Buildings, which was off Stepney Green close to the East London Synagogue.

Then on 20th August 1900, Hannah registerred Rebecca at the Stepney Jewish School and her address had changed to 59 Nelson Street.  It seems the family had regularly moved home in the last few years.  However, a year later the 1901 Census shows them still living at 59 Nelson Street.

{% include image.html url="/images/1901/CENSUS-1901-Solomons_Hannah-59_Nelson_Street.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="1901 Census for Hannah Solomons and family at 59 Nelson Street" %}

Louis is the only member of the family not listed on this census.  I have looked for Louis elsewhere and the nearest I have managed is a 16 year old boy called Louis Solomons, born in London, who is registered as an inmate of the [North Eastern Reformatory](http://www.childrenshomes.org.uk/NethertonRfy/) which is north of Newcastle.  If it is him then it seems a long way to be sent to this kind of institution. His occupation is listed as a General Field Worker.  It is certainly something to investigate further, and may go some way to supporting the stealing story mentioned earlier.

Both Esther and Hannah are working as Tailoress', whilst the only other worker is Hyman who has become a Cabinet Maker.  They occupy two rooms in the house, but they are not the only occupants of the house.  There is one room where Minnie Oclauick and her Traveller son Simon live, and the other room houses George and Mary Day.  George is listed as an employer and a Tailor, which lends itself to the possibility of Hannah and Esther working for him.

It is also worth noting the ages of some of the children is not correct.

The family's next known address is 22 Fullbourne Street and can be found on my Grandmother's birth certificate.  Esther had gone to New York in September 1906 and returned pregnant in 1907.  My Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstin, became Hannah's first grandchild on 7th June 1907 (25th Sivan 5667).  

{% include image.html url="/images/1907/BTH-19070607-Eva_lichtenstein.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Birth Certificate for Eva Lichtenstein" %}

There was a club which occupied 2-6 Fullbourne Street, and it served as the registration place for delegates to the [5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Congress_of_the_Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party) which took place in London between 10th May 1907 and 1st June 1907.  There was a preliminary session to the conference held at the club on 9th of May 1907.  I sometimes wonder if my heavily pregnant Great Grandmother walked past that club and saw the likes of Lenin, Trotsky, Rosa Luxembourg or Stalin on that day or at any time during the conference.

## 1 Regal Place, Old Montague Street

When Louis got married at the East London Synagogue to Annie Levy in 1910, the residence, for both of them, was 1 Regal Place.  This is an address my Mum told me about as she lived there with her parents and Hannah when she was very young.  It is fair to assume Hannah had moved to 1 Regal Place sometime after Eva was born in 1907 and before Louis and Annie's wedding in September 1910.

{% include image.html url="/images/1909/NEWS-19090206-Tower_Hamlets_Independent_and_East_End_Local_Advertiser-Page_5.png" dimensions="width='100%'" caption="Midnight Fatality at Whitechapel" %}

There is an article on page 5 of the East London Advertiser dated 6th February 1909 with the title of "MIDNIGHT FATALITY AT WHITECHAPEL".  It is about the death of a woman in 1 Regal Place called Fanny Savolocki in September 1908.  She appears to have not been able to sleep as she was worrying about a daughter who had left for South Africa, but hadn't been heard of since.  Her Grand Daughter woke up in the night and saw her Grandmother had fallen from the window into the yard below.  She was admitted into hospital and died on the Wednesday after her fall.  The fall took place on 27th September 1908.

I suspect Hannah and the family moved into 1 Regal Place soon after this tragic incident and may have been in 1 Regal Place in 1908.

The 1911 census was the first where the head of the household completed the form.  The house had four rooms and seven people living in it.  Hannah, at 49, was the head of the household.  She stated she had been married for 30 years, which places her marriage in the right timeframe for the marriage certificate of 1880 presented earlier.  She is a Tailoress who works from home.  Hannah claims she was born in London, which we know isn't true, but might be convenient.

Rachel, Dinah and Rebecca are her only children currently living at home.  Rachel is also a Tailoress like her Mum, and Dinah is a Furrier.  Both of them work away from home.  Rebecca is 14 years old and still at school, when I do not believe it was compulsory by law.  If so, it implies Hannah considered education important, and maybe some of the other children were in education longer than the law required.

My Grandmother, Eva Lichtenstein, also lives with Hannah.  She is 4 years old and goes to school.

Hannah has included a 22 year old married woman as he Daughter-in-Law.  Her surname is clearly Solomons, but her first name looks like it might be Cissie or even Lissie.  She has been married for four years and so it can only be Alexander's wife whose full maiden name is Elizabeth Annie Smith.  She was a Boot Machinist when she was married 4 years before and now she is being described as a Dressmaker.  This doesn't seem particularly likely.

The reason I think it is Alexander's wife is because Hyman is not married at this time, and Louis is on another Census return with his wife.  So where is Alexander?  I think he may be in Wormwood Scrubs prison as there is a man with his name and age listed on their return.

The last person declared on the Census is a boarder called George Oumen, who is a 26 year old Waiter from Russia Poland.

## Leaving home

Esther was the first of Hannah's children to give her a grandchild, but she probably wasn't married at the time.  If that is the case, then Alexander was the first to get married in 1907.  He'd already left home and was trying to make his way in the world.

Three of Hannah's children along with their spouses were living at 1 Regal Place when they married.  They were Louis and Annie Levy in 1910, Dinah and Isaac Abrahams in 1914, and Hyman and Rose Simons in 1918.  Rachael was living at 1 Regal Place when she married Mark Goldstein in 1918, so was Rebecca when she married Abraham Fagan in 1921.  

Esther and Kitty were married in Vancouver, Canada in 1919 and 1926 respectively so were not living at 1 Regal Place at the time of their marriages.

## ...to be completed

This blog post is not finished to the point where I want it to be, but I have published it and am working on completing it.  I am finding it quite difficult completing a blog post due to the research required.  I keep starting them, but not publishing as they are not "finished".  Frustrated by the situation, I find myself, I have decided to publish unfinished blogs when there is enough of a story, and return to finish them later.

I hope this is useful.
